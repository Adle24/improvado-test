How To Tackle B2B Marketing Attribution in 2023 As customer journeys become more complex and multichannel, and marketers employ more advanced strategies like omnichannel marketing, ABM, and personalization, the need for accurate and precise analytics with B2B marketing attribution as its centerpiece becomes more evident. Still, in 2022, a striking 58% of B2B marketers reported that their marketing analytics is inadequate or needs improvement. This article provides actionable insights and strategies to help you better understand the concepts, tools, and best practices of B2B marketing attribution. Whether you're just starting or refining your strategy, this guide will serve as a valuable resource for achieving marketing attribution success in 2023. What Is a B2B Marketing Funnel? Throughout the time consuming B2B sales funnel, a decision maker may come in contact with many of your marketing efforts. One single person might do all of the following things: See your Facebook ad Find your blog while searching a keyword on Google Download an eBook from your website Receive retargeting ads from Google Display View your Capterra ad while reading software reviews Get entered into your email nurture campaign Click on your branded Google ad Schedule a demo based off an email from your sales team Watch a webinar you sent via marketing emails And the list goes on. As a fellow marketer, I too am met with this challenge of attribution: determining where exactly my customers are coming from, which marketing efforts are having a positive impact and how to give each channel proper credit. I will walk you through how our marketing team implemented B2B marketing attribution. How to Build a B2B Marketing Attribution Model in 7 Steps Below are the 7 steps you need to take in order to execute B2B marketing attribution. Choose a source of truth. Collect event data about leads from your website. Connect each website lead with the channel they came from. Connect all leads at the Company level in your CRM or database. Define your attribution model Visualize your attribution model Pull actionable insights from your data I will provide more detail about each of these steps below. A visual schema of our B2B Marketing Attribution Model at Improvado. Step 1: Choose a source of truth. The first thing you need to do is choose a source of truth for your business. For example, your CRM or database can be used as your source of truth. For us at Improvado, our source of truth is Salesforce. Step 2: Collect event data about leads from your website. The next thing you need to do is make sure you are tracking leads who visit your website, and sending all that data to your source of truth. For example, we host our website on Webflow and we track events on our website using Mixpanel. We then use the Mixpanel API to send event data into our source of truth, which is Salesforce. What does it mean to track events? Events include every move a visitor makes on your website, including link clicks and page visits. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how we use Mixpanel to see that this individual downloaded a resource on our website and they were referred from google.com and we can even see their email and other actions they have taken on our site. ‍ Step 3: Connect each website lead with the channel they came from. You can do this in a number of ways. At Improvado, we do this by looking at the UTM attributes tied to a visitor's link or by looking at the ""Initial Referring Domain"" (if no UTM is visible). Step 4: Connect all leads at the Company level in your CRM or database. Often times there are multiple leads tied to one business. For example at Improvado, we have multiple ""Contacts"" connected to an ""Account"" in Salesforce. Step 5: Define your attribution model Depending on your team goals, you might decide to focus on a first click, last click, time decay, position based, or linear attribution model. Each of these attribution models gives different weight to channels based on where the interaction occurred in the customer journey. At Improvado we use a position based attribution model.  Step 6: Visualize your attribution model Send data from your source of truth to a Business Intelligence tool like Tableau, Looker, Google Data Studio or PowerBI, so that you can create visualizations of your marketing attribution model. Sync this data automatically using Improvado's API to send all your real-time marketing data (which includes paid channels, event tracking and sales data from Salesforce) into your visualization tool of choice. That way, it is easy to create visualizations that show your marketing attribution and performance over time. With Improvado, all it takes is a few clicks to send all this important data exactly where it needs to go, so we can visualize and share important insights with the team. Click here to try Improvado for yourself.‍ ‍ Improvado allows you to view all of your marketing performance data in one place. For example, the screenshot below shows how we are able to view spend and performance data from Twitter, Google Adwords, Facebook, Bing and Amazon Sponsored Placements side by side. Step 7: Pull actionable insights from your data We were able to use our position based attribution model to uncover which channels were generating the largest amount of revenue opportunities for our business. As you can see in the screenshot below, SEO drives a majority of our revenue opportunities and therefore we decided to triple down on content as a growth channel at Improvado and cut back on Facebook ad spend. This is what we like to call data-driven actionable insights.  Conclusion Setting up an automated B2B attribution system has allowed our team to see exactly which marketing efforts have led to opportunities and closed won deals. This allows us to optimize campaigns by funneling more budget into what works and cutting the cord on what doesn’t. With clearer insight into performance, we have been able to use our budget and time more efficiently on the channels that work best to increase ROI. "

Understanding how to read those KPIs and effectively track progress toward their completion is another. Displaying all KPIs on a single dashboard helps you create a coherent data story to help teams reach and exceed their goals. Without the dashboard, it’s often hard to see the forest for the trees and confidently navigate through all objectives. Ready to learn more about KPI dashboards and explore how to build one for yourself? Then, let’s dive in. Key Takeaways KPI dashboards combine data from various sources and display key insights using visual elements such as charts and graphs. Effective KPI dashboards are focused and goal-centric, including only the data end-users need to answer KPI-specific business queries. Some key benefits of KPI dashboards include facilitating executive decision-making, identifying opportunities and underperformance, increasing team collaboration and transparency, and facilitating real-time data analysis at scale. To create a KPI dashboard, first choose the KPIs and metrics to track. Then select the relevant data sources. Once you’ve identified these, visualize the data using relevant charts and graphs. Lastly, share the dashboard. Follow best practices to build KPI dashboards that everyone trusts. Include only data relevant to the goals, use text and interactive elements effectively, be visually consistent, keep it simple, and use good-quality data. Analytics tools like Improvado can automatically sync all your data from different sources, ensure all your data has satisfactory quality, and provide you with a KPI dashboard that will serve as a single source of truth for your teams. What Are KPI Dashboards? Improvado’s KPI dashboard template KPIs or key performance indicators are measurements that track how well a company, department, team, or person is progressing toward a goal. In other words, they are success metrics calculated based on data from different sources. KPI dashboards show progress on KPIs in a visual, easily digestible format to help inform business decisions. Real-time dashboards automate any manual data wrangling processes, allowing teams to focus on uncovering insights into their goal progress. KPI dashboards are a necessary foundation for teams and companies that want to join the data-driven side. However, ensuring you use good-quality data to avoid false insights is vital. What Do KPI Dashboards Include? A KPI dashboard includes all the relevant data end users need to make data-driven decisions for ultimate goal achievement and to adjust their strategy on the go. The included metrics depend on the dashboard’s audience. What’s their goal? What question do they want to have answered? Which KPIs are important for the audience to gauge performance? What data can best help them get actionable business insights? Once you’ve determined these variables, choose all the relevant data you need to include in the dashboard. Use various visualization techniques, such as trend analysis over time and comparatives and benchmarks, to provide more context. Also, add annotations to the visuals to help describe the data to the end user. Improvado’s cross-channel KPI dashboard Key Business Benefits of KPI Dashboards Data is only useful when you can make sense of it. However, making sense of it gets increasingly complicated with the growing amount of data you collect. That’s what KPI dashboards help you with. Let’s review how exactly this is achieved. Facilitates effective executive decision-making With a KPI dashboard, executives don’t have to wait for different departments to report on their activities and performance. All of this information is stored in a single source of truth for the company’s KPIs. Executives have a real-time view of each team’s performance and contribution to the organization’s bottom line. This means they can see which units and processes to focus on to achieve business goals faster. Improves operational efficiency and effectiveness KPI dashboards streamline organizational workflow, making it easy for employees to work efficiently. Let’s say the marketing team needs data on the lead-to-customer conversion rate from the sales team or the customer satisfaction index score from the customer support team. In these cases, they can get this info from the KPI dashboard without waiting for someone to hand them the data, stopping the time-consuming back and forth between different parties. Increases collaboration and transparency between teams With a shared KPI dashboard of real-time data, teams can easily make decisions without waiting for another person’s input. This democratizes data, fostering collaboration and accelerating communication, ultimately leading to better team alignment and happier employees. Facilitates real-time data analysis at scale The real-time delivery of KPI dashboards gives executives insights into business operations as they happen. Using a dashboard's interactive elements, they can drill down into each specific KPI without going through many spreadsheets or wading through different programs. Provides valuable data for predicting business growth KPIs tell you how you're progressing toward a goal. With a KPI dashboard, you have a tool that helps you assess the direction your business is heading. You can better see patterns and forecast business growth—and with that, decide the next steps that will allow you to reach your business objectives efficiently. Provides insights on what to prioritize Data overwhelm is a huge problem for many decision-makers. Having dashboards on relevant KPIs—fueled by good-quality data— means you can better analyze business operations without being overwhelmed. Since dashboards properly organize and visualize critical information, you can quickly identify what to focus on and prioritize. Steps for Creating KPI Dashboards Developing a KPI dashboard is an intricate and time-consuming activity. But, not for those who know the right steps and use the right tools to visualize KPIs. Choose the KPIs and metrics to track What questions do end-users want to have answered and what information do they need? Consider this when creating a KPI dashboard, so you don't end up featuring vanity metrics. Focus only on the most crucial metrics for the monitored activity. For example, if you’re building a sales pipeline dashboard, you definitely don’t need to include CLTV or CPA, because salespeople have almost nothing to do with these metrics. Most KPI dashboards use the MAD framework—a three-level approach to creating dashboards. It includes the monitor level for high-level KPIs like annual recurring revenue or relative market share, the analysis level for analyzing KPIs across various departments, and the drill level for detailed KPIs for deep-dive analysis. Select relevant data sources Evaluate all your available data sources and decide which ones are relevant. This isn't always straightforward, especially with the many tools businesses use nowadays. Choose data sources wisely because each new one comes with engineering and maintenance hassles. You’ll have to connect each source to your dashboarding tool, fetch the right data, transform it into a digestible form, and come up with new charts to visualize it. Not to mention that data sources come with unique APIs which require frequent updates on the back-end. A better option is to connect all required data sources with an automated analytics platform. For example, Improvado integrates with 500+ different marketing and sales data sources to quickly extract data and streamline it to a dashboard tailored to the user’s objectives. With Improvado’s plug-and-play approach, you can jumpstart your analytics and scale it as you go by adding data sources from the library.

On a 30-min call, we’ll identify your business objectives and come up with a dashboard prototype tailored to your use case. Schedule a call Create suitable charts and graphs KPI dashboard for paid ads by Improvado Data visualization is no less important a task than data collection. Your main challenge is to come up with the right way to narrate your story with charts and graphs. For example, if you want to compare values, use bar charts and scatter plot charts. For analyzing trends, line and column charts are ideal. You can use charts like Mekko/Marimekko to understand data distribution. Yet again, building your visualization from scratch requires analytical know-how and experience with business intelligence tools. But you can take the easy path. Improvado offers a variety of dashboard templates for your marketing and sales data. You don’t have to create any charts. Just connect the data sources, choose a template, and modify the charts however you want. That’s how you save time on dashboard development while having the same flexibility provided by business intelligence tools.

You can also export it into a PDF document for sharing through emails, meetings, or presentations. Best Practices to Build a KPI Dashboard Creating effective KPI dashboards becomes easier when you follow some best practices. Include only KPIs relevant to the goals Always be aware of the audience and why they need a KPI dashboard. What do they want to know? What KPIs do they need to compare and contrast? Building the dashboard with your audience in mind will reveal what information should be included. Use text effectively Your data is telling a story. As much as the charts and graphs illustrate that, so does the language you use for labeling and descriptions. Get clear on the insights you want to get across using well-thought-out annotation principles. Clearly label interactive elements and make it obvious that they are clickable or drillable. Aim for visual consistency Having a nice-looking KPI dashboard is a key element of effective dashboards. Your ultimate goal is to display data that key people in the organization can quickly get insights into. One way to do this is by sticking to consistent colors and styles and applying visual design principles. Keep it simple It's easy to get excited about the various charts and graphs you can make out of all your data, but clutter ruins KPI dashboards. Make them as simple as possible. Overcrowding with irrelevant data—no matter how interesting—will only distract from the narrative you're trying to convey. Ensure you’re using clean data KPI dashboards make data easy to understand. But it's of no use if this data is from poor-quality sources. Before creating a dashboard, ensure that the integrity and accuracy of your data are sound. How to Create a KPI Dashboard with Improvado Creating a KPI dashboard is a time suck, although an extremely valuable time suck. If you do everything right, from data collection to styling your charts, you get a single source of truth for any of your business activities. Marketing analytics platforms make the process 10X easier. You just plug in the required data sources, choose the metrics you want to track, then choose a dashboard template that suits you.

The Shopify dashboard serves as your virtual command center, where you can view and analyze all metrics affecting your business growth and make your decisions backed up by data, not gut feeling. What sort of information does the dashboard provide you? Shopify reports can tell you what triggers the abandonment of carts, the amount of revenue generated in a certain period, the number of both new and returning customers you have, and much more besides. Learn how to build an intuitively easy-to-use dashboard encompassing all the Shopify metrics you need to observe. In this article, you will learn: Why build a Shopify dashboard? What metrics should a Shopify dashboard include? The best examples of Shopify and ecommerce dashboards. How marketing analytics platforms can help you track your Shopify store performance. Why Build a Shopify Dashboard? Whether it be a fast-evolving start-up or a well-established enterprise, your store generates so much data that it’s almost impossible to keep an eye on every single metric. That said, you’re unlikely to see a fuller picture of your business performance. However, this can be easily solved with an all-in-one Shopify dashboard that presents all your data in an easily digestible and understandable view. Let’s dive deeper into the benefits it brings to you. It helps you make informed decisions faster Without proper Shopify data visualization solutions that integrate with other tools (such as social media business accounts or AI-based solutions for Shopify users), users waste a lot of time. Analysts have to join and update data across platforms manually, which always implies a certain risk of human error. If figures don’t stack up, their efforts have basically gone up in smoke — you cannot act on the misleading information. And how is that efficient? What is indubitably efficient and speeds up your decision-making is a marketing analytics platform that gathers all Shopify metrics and combines them with data from other ad platforms to display it on a centralized dashboard. For example, Improvado enables you with cross-channel dashboards to understand how your marketing efforts influence your store’s performance. Data visualization is just a step on the long business journey! Improvado ensures the quality of data and its flow across all the sources you use, seamlessly transforms and visualizes it in an analysis-ready manner.

Actionable insights for all parties Different specialists use different metrics to assess marketing performance. While CFO operates with metrics such as monthly revenue and average order value, marketers focus on the cost of acquisition, conversions, and brand awareness metrics. A customizable Shopify dashboard provides equally useful insights for all parties. A global overview might show basic metrics that provide a general picture of the performance. When diving deeper, a comprehensive Shopify dashboard contains all revenue and marketing-related metrics. Here’s an example of Improvado’s executive summary dashboard that shows how your marketing campaigns perform across all channels: Improvado's paid search dashboard : overview The same exact dashboard shows you the metrics across each keyword you’re targeting with your paid ads: Improvado's paid search dashboard : keyword performance While the executive summary tab shows the overall impact of marketing efforts to the C-Suite or stakeholders, the keyword performance tab lets marketers optimize their campaigns for relevant search queries, making this dashboard a universal analytics tool for all team members. A single source of truth for cross-channel marketing Shopify marketing goes well beyond Google Shopping and Facebook Ads. These days, successful e-commerce businesses use a variety of platforms, from TikTok to Pinterest, to find new audiences and activate new customers. Let alone classic data sources, such as online store analytics systems, Google Analytics, and email marketing software. Recently, Shopify rolled out its new ‘Audiences’ feature designed to help marketers attribute purchases from different ad accounts (e.g., Facebook Ads). What it basically does, is match the email of the order with the customer’s Facebook email to then identify the most promising audiences for your business. The main issue of Shopify’s “Audiences” is the number of supported data sources. It only allows you to gather audiences across Facebook and Google Ads. Currently, marketers need to keep an eye on way more platforms than Facebook and Google. That’s where marketing analytics platforms make a world of difference. Improvado uses an attribution system that can smoothly integrate with any ad platform in Improvado’s library. With its help, you can connect the dots between marketing, sales, and financial data and identify the most promising audiences across all your ad channels. With 500+ different integrations, there won’t be any platform left that you can’t attribute revenue from. Here’s an example of the attribution dashboard that uses different attribution models to analyze performance across channels by Improvado: Improvado’s attribution From gut feelings to clear-cut dashboards. With data constantly pulled right, left, and center, keeping a firm grip on it is absolutely vital. Not only does accurate data enable the reliability of the analysis, but it also expands its scope.

What Should a Shopify Dashboard Include? Improvado’s Shopify dashboard template If you have a look at the best marketing dashboard examples, you will see that they usually contain information such as: the efficiency of marketing campaigns (including those in top retail media networks and social media), sales results, customer behavior, inventory level, operational costs. Selecting the right metrics for your Shopify dashboard strongly depends on your position in the e-commerce company and what your tasks are. Data should be presented in the form of charts, tables, and other types of visualization. Any Shopify sales dashboard should provide you with the following metrics and KPIs: Traffic Traffic is the number of visits in a chosen period. This way, you can assess whether interest in your online store is growing or if you need to expand your marketing and advertising to increase traffic. Let’s take a look at Improvado’s cross-channel dashboard. It displays all vital metrics about your marketing performance, enabling you to see the performance of each campaign and channel in a single tab. Besides, you can monitor metrics broken down by gender, age, and geographical regions. Improvado’s paid ads dashboard : overview ‍ For marketers interested solely in web traffic overview, Pradeep Kumar G shared a comprehensive web traffic dashboard. It shows every traffic-related metric, from the total number of sessions to the best-performing referral domains. Web traffic dashboard example‍ Bounce rate Bounce rate informs you what percentage of all sessions ended up viewing only a single page. To put it simpler, it shows you what part of your visitors wasn’t satisfied with your online store, at least as much to go check other pages than the one they’ve landed on. According to Oberlo, the average bounce rate for e-commerce companies reached 47% in Q2 of 2022. User Behavior It's not exactly a metric but rather a set of different metrics that helps you find the most promising customers and optimize user journeys, listings, and more. Here’s an example of a Shopify dashboard that shows the breakdown of customers by geographical region, types of purchased products, purchase frequency, and more. Shopify customer journey dashboard‍ Add to cart rate and abandoned cart rate Add to cart rate is the percentage of users that added some products to the cart during their visit. The other metric tells you what part of users abandon their carts and leave your e-commerce website without finalizing their transactions. The add-to-cart rate depends heavily on the type of goods you’re selling. Recent statistics from Oberlo show that everyday goods and groceries have a higher add-to-cart rate compared to luxurious items or large goods, such as furniture. Add-to-Cart rate benchmark by industry As for cart abandonment, the average rate for the retail industry stands at 72.8%. Yet again, the rate varies depending on the type of product you’re selling. According to Bolt, fashion goods have the highest cart abandonment rate of 40%. Cart abandonment rate stats by industry A Shopify sales dashboard helps you understand whether your shop is in line with the industry’s benchmarks, why users abandon their carts, and what are the points of improvement. Conversion rates and total sales You should analyze the conversion rate to learn if a proper percentage of visitors take the desired action on your store’s website. The goal may be signing in to the newsletter database or making a purchase. Since buying is a widespread, final-stage conversion, you need to keep an eye on goals higher up the funnel to understand the percentage of users that become actual buyers. How many people that subscribed to your newsletter eventually became customers? What’s the percentage of users that made a purchase after a cart abandonment email? A well-designed Shopify dashboard should answer all of these questions. Average order value Average order value (AOV) helps sales specialists and marketers to define their next goals, devise a strategy and leverage discounts or recommendation systems. If it is too small, a company can offer additional products for an extra price or grant free delivery for orders above a given value. AOV is calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of orders. However, for more detailed visualization, you can calculate the average order value by country or region. Here’s an example: Average order value by region dashboard example New vs. returning customers and customer lifetime value It is essential to know how many of your visitors are new customers who have returned to buy again. You can track your clients’ behavior and assess their loyalty. To learn if your acquisition campaigns are cost-effective, you can check your customer acquisition cost. The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) helps you to measure the profitability of your customers (how much money they are willing to spend during your entire relationship with your business) and allows you to better adjust personalized campaigns. Here’s a formula to help you calculate CLV: Average customer lifetime value = (average number of transactions per month) * (average order value) * (average gross margin) * (average customer lifespan) / number of clients for the particular period. There’s a vast space for experiments when displaying customer lifetime value. For example, you can find the most profitable customers by breaking down audiences into groups based on different criteria (sales channel, education, location, etc.). Online Store Sessions This metric allows you to learn how much time visitors spend on your website. A session starts when users visit your store and ends when they leave (the session is also considered ended if a visitor doesn't interact with content for 30 minutes). In general, if the session is short, it can mean that the visitor is unsatisfied with the website (because he can’t find a particular product or find the website boring or non-intuitive, etc.). According to different benchmarks, the median value for average session duration for B2C companies is 92.33 seconds. Online store sessions are considered a tricky metric thought because it is difficult to decide how long the session should last. Inventory level In business, capital should flow. A high inventory level can mean that your capital is frozen. Information about inventory levels in specific periods, presented on the Shopify dashboard, can be used to adjust the store’s offer to the market’s demand. Of course, inventory level also helps to manage products by making orders at the right time and in the right amounts. Shipping costs Online store owners should make sure that products are being shipped efficiently. With access to such data in your Shopify dashboard, you can react fast when you realize that you overspend on shipping and delivery. There are various ways to handle situations like that – you can negotiate new terms with your partners, increase the cost of delivery or raise the minimal value of the order for your customers.

DashThis DashThis is a simple digital marketing reporting tool. DashThis is another data reporting platform designed for marketing professionals and agencies. The platform focuses on helping digital marketers generate simple, automated reports for PPC/SEM campaigns, email marketing, social media, and SEO. The platform offers around 34 integrations, encompassing some major marketing platforms. For custom data, DashThis provides a CSV file manager that allows you to import custom data in CSV formats. Alternatively, you can use its Google Sheets Integration to work around challenges with custom data sources. DashThis offers preset widgets and prebuilt report templates for different use cases. It also provides a white labeling option more flexible than AgencyAnalytics' offering. Users generally complain about inaccurate data, limited granularity, steep pricing, poor filtering capabilities, and the inability to quickly switch between data sources. DashThis Use Case DashThis is specifically designed for marketing teams running PPC, email marketing, and social media campaigns, among others. The platform's customers include small businesses, non-profits, and enterprises in various industries. In general, DashThis doesn't offer many advanced features in a bid to focus on simplicity. Thus, the platform is basic enough for non-technical users. Users can leverage the platform for PPC, eCommerce, SEO, and general marketing reporting. DashThis doesn't seem to offer professional services, but users get access to a very active customer support team to help them through platform-related challenges. DashThis Pricing DashThis offers four pricing plans: Individual, Professional, Business, and Standard, costing $39, $129, $249, and $399 per month, respectively. Users on the Business and Standard plans are the only ones eligible for the platform's full features. While Business users are limited to 25 dashboards, Standard users get to create 50 dashboards. For Standard users, there’s the opportunity to increase your dashboard limit at additional costs. DashThis Integration DashThis offers integrations to 34 platforms, which is relatively low compared to its counterparts. There is no means for requesting a custom integration on the platform. However, the platform does offer a CSV file tool that users can utilize while working with custom data sources. It also integrates with Google Sheets, which you can use to work around this hurdle. Whatagraph Whatagraph is a marketing reporting tool built for small businesses and agencies. Whatagraph is another marketing platform designed for marketing agencies and in-house marketing teams. The platform is quite similar to DashThis, offering solutions for PPC, call tracking, SEM reporting, and more. The platform offers 40+ native integrations and also makes provisions for requesting custom integrations. Whatagraph offers a template gallery containing ready-made dashboards for faster data visualization and reporting. It also allows users to create custom reports using its Smart Builder, which reportedly has impressive customizability. The platform also offers report scheduling functionalities, allowing users to fully automate the reporting process, from initial building to sharing. Additionally, Whatagraph offers a flexible white labeling option where you can use your brand logo, change the color themes, and make structural changes to match your brand identity. That said, the platform isn’t without its flaws, as users complain of steep and inflexible pricing, poor loading speed, and filtering limitations. Similar to AgencyAnalytics, Whatagraph is suitable for small businesses and marketing agencies: Its data granularity is relatively low, making it difficult for users to go as deep as they want with their marketing data. Whatagraph mostly integrates with social media platforms and other marketing tools but lacks sales data source connectors, which makes it difficult to map the whole customer journey, from ad click to check amount. Global brands tend to go with Improvado–a solution with advanced features, a large catalog of data source connectors, endless customization options, and capable of processing large volumes of data. Book a consultation with an Improvado expert to see how the solution can streamline your global marketing reporting. Whatagraph Use Cases Whatagraph is mainly for marketing agencies and in-house marketers. Thus it offers several functionalities relevant to these groups. This includes over 80 reporting templates, cross-channel analytics, data blending, and more.

Whatagraph Pricing Whatagraph offers three pricing tiers: Professional, Premium, and Custom. At the basic level, Professional costs $199 per month, while Premium costs $299 per month. Custom is reserved for large agencies and companies with complex reporting needs. Thus, its pricing is customized for each user. The Professional plan limits you to 25 data sources and 5 team members. However, you can increase your data source limit all the way to 50. However, this attracts additional costs, up to $349 per month. On the other hand, the Premium plan limits you to 50 data sources and allows you to increase this at additional costs. It is also important to note that Whatagraph only has around 40 integrations. So, by “data sources”, they’re merely referring to the number of connection points you have with each integration. For example: one Facebook account, three Google Analytics views, and one TikTok account equals five data sources. Whatagraph Integrations Whatagraph offers 40+ integrations, encompassing major marketing platforms in every business's marketing stack. This includes analytics, social media, email marketing, and call-tracking platforms, among others. The platform makes it possible for users to request custom connectors.

The platform offers ETL capabilities that users can leverage to pull data from diverse sources, combine them in dashboards and reports, and access customized ROI and performance insights. Singular integrates with over 1,000 platforms, spanning advertising, attribution, analytics, audience, and ad monetization platforms.

Thus, its mobile attribution solution packs some of its best functionalities. For marketers using only web-based channels, Singular performs attribution using JavaScript tags which track visitors and provide reports on their behavior. In general, Singular doesn't provide extensive historical analytics. And being a mobile-first platform, if your company has a combination of app and web presence, Singular may not be suitable for you from the web side of things. There is also an issue with the granularity of data by Singular as the platform doesn’t offer identifiers for server-side sources like email and phone numbers. To manage data sharing with these types of identifiers, you’d need a different data platform. Improvado works with first-party cookies and in the cookieless environment, features a large catalog of data source connectors, and seamlessly processes large volumes of data. These features allow brands to analyze the performance of all their marketing efforts, identify high-impact touchpoints, the most frequently occurring events for a specific audience, and which events trigger the prospect to advance through the awareness ladder. Singular Use Cases Singular is designed specifically for marketing professionals and agencies. However, the platform focuses more on marketers who use mobile advertising. It does offer cross-platform solutions for enterprise users. However, users with mobile and web presence have reported limitations on the web-related analytics. The platform is generally easy to operate and is, thus, suitable for non-technical users. But sharing reports with clients is a manual process with Singular, making it quite time-consuming for agencies working with multiple clients. Singular caters to companies in a variety of industries. Singular Pricing Singular offers two pricing plans: Growth and Enterprise. Pricing for each plan is undisclosed. Users on the Growth Plan get access to the platform’s core features. However, advanced offerings like custom data connectors and destinations, enterprise SLA, and private cloud (add-on) can only be accessed by Enterprise users.

Imagine a quarterly report presented to the C-Suite saying that your team doubled the impressions and gained a 20% growth in followers. While these numbers are valuable for the social media team, CFOs and CEOs operate with completely different metrics. They want to see how social media contributes to the revenue growth and what’s the ROI of your efforts. A holistic media dashboard is an effective way to get granular insights for your day-to-day tasks, as well as to provide an overview of all KPIs to stakeholders. A visualized story of your activities during the quarter better explains how those posts, clicks, and engagement impact revenue generation. Here, we’re exploring what a social media dashboard is, why it’s crucial for businesses today, and the best practices to know when using third-party solutions. We will also look at real-world examples to help you understand the power of an effective social media analytics dashboard. Get a social media dashboard without all the data hassle BOOK A CALL WITH IMPROVADO What Is a Social Media Dashboard? Social media platforms overview A social media dashboard is a type of online marketing dashboard that helps you maximize ROI of your social media campaigns by providing an overview of key metrics and explaining how they drive your company to its goals.

Social media dashboards enable you to monitor campaigns on-the-go, reevaluate your marketing strategy, optimize social media ads, and make informed decisions generally. What should be in a social media dashboard? Different metrics serve different goals. While impressions might indicate the growth of brand awareness, direct social purchases on social media influence bottom-funnel conversions. The charts and visualization styles might differ from dashboard to dashboard, but there’s a set of essential metrics that always need to be present on your social media dashboard. Let’s go through all the vital metrics that should be present on your dashboard. But first, take a look at a LinkedIn overview dashboard from Improvado showcasing all vital metrics you need to keep an eye on. Social media dashboard for LinkedIn organic analytics Reach Reach refers to the total number of unique accounts that have seen your ads. Reach is most often used to get a better understanding of your brand awareness. Reach is considered to be a vanity metric that doesn’t show the real impact of your social efforts on the company’s bottom line. However, it’s still important to know how many users have seen your ads, if your business is scaling and aiming for new audiences. Without emphasizing on reach, many of your potential customers would have never heard of your brand, offer, or strong message. Here’s an example of a social media engagement and reach dashboard showing you how many impressions, clicks, shares, and other metrics were generated by each of your social media posts. Tableau's social media engagement dashboard Engagement rate Engagement rate is another essential metric for a social media dashboard. It measures the amount of interaction a piece of content gets compared to reach or account’s followers count. Here’s a formula to calculate the engagement rate for your social media marketing dashboard: Engagement rate = Total Engagement / Total Followers (Reach) * 100% Total Engagement is the sum of all interactions you consider to be an engagement (likes, share, comments, etc.) Total followers is the number of users who follow your social media account. Total followers is often changed to total reach, which is the total number of impressions generated by a particular post. If you’re feeling a bit lazy to calculate it yourself, Hootsuite offers a free social media engagement rate calculator. When it comes to displaying engagement rate on a social media dashboard, the visualization can be as simple as a regular line chart. Social media engagement line chart Alternatively, you can get more creative and come up with a scatter plot like this. It shows the correlation between each post’s engagement rate and reach. Social media engagement scatter plot Follower growth rate Follower growth rate measures the speed at which your social media account is growing its audience. It is an invaluable indicator of your campaigns’ health. Plus, it helps you understand how do you keep up against your competitors and assess the projected share of voice for your brand on social media. Use this formula to calculate your follower growth rate: Number of new followers / Total number of followers * 100 Social media monitoring dashboards usually have follower growth rates depicted in a form of a line chart. With a chart like this it’s easy to spot peaks and troughs within a given timeline. Social media follower growth chart Engagement metrics per post This category includes all most common social media metrics such as likes, shares, replies, comments, etc. These metrics are a barometer of how your posts resonate with your audience. An engagement overview social dashboard is a go-to tool for marketers when analyzing their previous campaigns, optimizing them, and planning on new ones. C-level metrics Frankly, most executives don’t dive deep into reach or follower growth rates. They often don’t have time to figure out how these metrics influence actual company performance. That’s why you need a dashboard that speaks the same language as executives do. The language of revenue. Executive dashboards are often tailored to each executive, so they can draw up quick conclusions in their areas of expertise. Some of the metrics are share of voice, earned media value, cost per acquisition, competitor analysis data, and more. Why Build a Social Media Dashboard? There are multiple reasons you want to use a social media dashboard. Most notably, a dashboard offers transparency, insights to optimize strategy, real-time data, and automated reporting, making analysis simple, quick, and effective. Ensure quick access to performance insights Social media dashboards offer the visibility needed to track performance across all social media campaigns. With an effective dashboard, you can monitor campaigns in real time, identify trends quickly, and make informed decisions that help you optimize your strategies and course correct when needed. In addition, this level of insight helps you stay ahead of the competition by ensuring you take advantage of every opportunity available. Real-time streamlined data collection Dashboards also streamline data collection from multiple sources into one central location. By aggregating data from all of your social channels, you gain valuable insight about customer behavior without having to manually search through each platform individually. In turn, you can better understand how customers interact with your brand online and tailor your marketing plan accordingly. Automated reporting & analysis Finally, the best social media dashboard will offer automated reporting and analysis capabilities, enabling you to save time when analyzing large amounts of data. For example, some dashboards have built-in analytics tools so that you can generate reports based on specific metrics like engagement rate or click-through rate (CTR) over a certain period of time. This means you can measure success more accurately than ever before. Additionally, many dashboards are equipped with AI algorithms that detect patterns in user behavior so you can spot potential opportunities fast and act even faster. Best Practices for Successful Social Media Dashboard Design Social media dashboard tools are essential in today’s online marketing efforts. To get the most out of your dashboard, there are certain best practices to keep in mind. Centralize data from all social media channels To get a comprehensive social media dashboard you have to gather the required data first. That’s a complex process which requires your marketing team to: Define the list of social media platforms Set up API connections for every platform Set up a data storage capable of processing large amounts of data Load data into a centralized storage for further transformations This is where marketing teams often face challenges. Since this step requires programming and database management know-how, non-technical marketers often can’t handle the task by themselves. As a result, they either stop building the dashboard or try to gather data manually, which becomes outdated by the time they finish gathering it. Let Improvado streamline your marketing data Improvado integrates with 500+ data sources to help you build a comprehensive dashboard. On a 30-min call, you can tell us more about your social media objectives to get a dashboard tailored to your needs. Schedule a call Ensure high data granularity It is essential to have the ability to get as granular as possible when creating a social media dashboard. Gaining deeper insights into the performance of each channel is the number one goal, so the more data you can access the more effective your dashboard will be. Granular performance metrics across all platforms allow you to better tailor content and campaigns to maximize social media marketing impact. Some social media dashboards allow you to dig deeper into different granularity levels. For example, Improvado’s paid social ads dashboard aggregates data from all social platforms and provides insights into channel, campaign, ad set, and each individual ad performance. With this level of insights, you can analyze your paid ads performance aggregatively or go deeper into performance of creatives and messaging. Feed your dashboards with harmonized data For your dashboard to be effective, it needs accurate data from all sources in a consistent format that’s easy to understand. The major problem for today is that different platforms use different data formats and naming conventions. This means you can’t simply stitch data from different APIs into a single storage or spreadsheet without additional data manipulations. These manipulations include: Data deduplication Cross-channel data mapping Alignment of naming conventions Joining and unioning data tables with SQL Yet again, non-technical marketers can’t execute these processes properly and often push faulty data right to the dashboard. It results in blind spots in marketing analytics and leads to poor decisions. Use automated alerts & reports Automated alerts & reports provide real-time updates on key metrics such as: Impressions Clicks Conversions Etc. Armed with this information, it is easier to stay ahead of any changes in campaign performance without having to constantly monitor each platform manually every day. Be sure to set thresholds within the system, so you can receive notifications when certain metrics exceed or fall below identified levels. You want to have ample time to react so that you can be as proactive as possible before any potential issues arise that might result in lost revenue opportunities or worse.

A content marketing dashboard visually represents key metrics related to a company's content marketing efforts. It provides a centralized platform to track and analyze various metrics, such as website traffic, engagement, leads, and conversions, which can help marketing teams optimize their marketing strategies and improve content performance. The primary role of a content marketing dashboard is to help teams monitor the performance of organic channels. By tracking key metrics, teams can evaluate their efforts' effectiveness and adjust their strategies accordingly to achieve better results. Content marketing dashboards usually provide a real-time view of metrics, allowing teams to make content tweaks, redesign distribution strategies, check keyword positions, etc. They can also help teams set specific goals and track progress against those goals. In a nutshell, a content marketing dashboard eliminates the need to switch between different analytics tools and platforms. By having all the relevant information in one place, teams can streamline data analysis and reporting, saving time and resources. Find this and 11 other marketing dashboards in our comprehensive list of ready-to-use marketing dashboards and templates. Who Should Use a Content Marketing Dashboard? Content marketing dashboards are versatile enough to not only help regular content marketers, but also fulfill the needs of C-level marketing executives. Let's look at how different organizational roles can use it to improve their content marketing campaigns. Content Marketing Managers Content marketing managers can use the content marketing dashboard to understand how their day-to-day activities convert into numbers. By tracking content performance metrics, such as page views, average time on page, bounce rate, etc., they can assess whether the content is engaging enough and make necessary adjustments if required. Additionally, the dashboard tracks the goals set for content pieces, such as trial requests, resource downloads, email form completion, etc. These goals show which content pieces drive your department to different objectives and which pieces should be optimized. C-level Marketing Executives C-level marketing executives use content marketing dashboards to evaluate the effectiveness of their content marketing strategy and the ROI of content marketing campaigns to make data-driven decisions. With this information, they can align the content department’s activities with global business goals and optimize content budgets. What’s more, data from content marketing dashboards is an integral part of the quarterly/annual marketing report which CMOs present to the board. If the report proves that the organic channel generates enough revenue, the CFO might allocate more resources to scale successful content marketing activities. Finally, the dashboard also might show the share of voice owned by your company compared to competitors. This info might be useful to better understand the reach of your content and the global share of the market occupied by your organization in the niche market. Performance Marketing Managers Performance marketing managers closely cooperate with content marketers. For example, teams often distribute promising content pieces via paid search ads and social media ads. Performance marketers can use the content marketing dashboard to assess the quality of incoming paid traffic and decide whether it’s worth investing in paid ads to promote the content piece. Another point of intersection between performance and content teams is the messaging used on paid creatives. Performance marketers monitor different campaigns to understand which images or narrative works best. Having a separate dashboard that tracks the performance of different creatives helps performance marketers identify the most promising messaging and adjust other campaigns according to this messaging. Here’s, for example, how it works with Improvado’s paid ads dashboard: Why Use a Content Marketing Dashboard? Content marketing dashboards are essential for marketing teams as they provide a centralized platform to track and analyze metrics related to their content marketing efforts. Here are some benefits of using a content marketing dashboard: Increased visibility Content marketing dashboards offer a comprehensive view of marketing performance, providing real-time insights into data, including pageviews, clicks, social media engagement, leads, and conversions. This increased visibility can help teams identify trends, discover opportunities, and optimize their strategies in real time. Improved accountability A clear record of goals in a content marketing dashboard makes teams more accountable for their activities. More accountability motivates teams to achieve their targets and sets a clear course for a team, which makes it more productive. Better decision-making Content marketing dashboards enable teams to make informed decisions by providing access to real-time data. With a clear understanding of what's working and what's not, teams can optimize their content, improve overall messaging, and make accurate strategic decisions. Customization A content marketing dashboard can be customized to fit a team's specific needs. Teams can choose the metrics they want to track, the charts and graphs they want to use, and the overall layout of the dashboard. Customization allows teams to be more flexible and tailor the dashboard to their specific business objectives. Increased efficiency A content marketing dashboard doesn’t make much sense without a solid data infrastructure behind it. A dashboard development process also includes streamlining data collection, transformation, storing, and loading into the dashboard itself. Marketers often struggle to fulfill all the steps on their own due to the required level of technical expertise. However, with some external help from analysts or third-party vendors’ automation, the dashboard will be powered with real-time data, leaving marketers more time to focus on campaigns and analysis instead of spending time on gathering data. Additionally, studies have shown that incorporating analytics tools, such as a content marketing dashboard, can lead to greater success in content marketing. A study by Content Marketing Institute found that 84% of the most successful content marketers use analytics tools to manage content. By utilizing a content marketing dashboard, marketing teams can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging real-time data to optimize their strategies, increase accountability, and ultimately achieve their content marketing goals. What Metrics to Include in a Content Marketing Dashboard According to the 2022 State of Marketing Report by Salesforce, 72% of high-performing marketers analyze marketing performance in real-time. This highlights the importance of having a content marketing dashboard that provides a centralized platform to track and analyze marketing metrics, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions. Let’s take a closer look at metrics used by different roles in various reporting scenarios: Day-to-Day Content Marketing Metrics We’ll start with the content marketing metrics that your team should closely monitor every day. These metrics allow your team to understand how search engines rank their content, how engaging the content is to readers, and how it helps you achieve your goals. Content marketing dashboard example Impressions This metric shows you how many people are seeing your content. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are getting the most traction and identify the characteristics of the content piece that make it stand out on search engines. On the other hand, a sharp decline in impressions may indicate that the search engine doesn’t consider the content piece to be informative or trustworthy. In this case, you have to update it according to the E-A-T principle. Clicks / CTR This metric shows how many people click on your content. By tracking clicks, you can understand how engaging the content’s title is. If your piece has a high SERP position but doesn’t generate enough traffic, you need to come up with a more catchy title. You can use the chart below as a CTR benchmark for your content pieces. The higher your article is on SERP, the higher the projected CTR is. Bounce rate This metric shows the percentage of people leaving your site after viewing only one page. By tracking this metric on each content piece, you can identify which pieces of content aren’t engaging enough or don’t have the required navigational elements to prolong the user journey on your website. Marketers who promote products with longer sales cycles should keep a close eye on this metric. The more touchpoints users have with your brand, the more willing they are to buy your product. Keyword ranking This metric shows how your content ranks for specific keywords. Keyword ranks are extremely important to know the estimated amount of traffic each piece brings to your website and understand how your content compares to competitors’ pieces. In addition to monitoring your ranks, you can also check competitors’ keywords. At some point, you might realize that your rivals rank for keywords that aren’t covered on your blog. If the keyword cluster is in line with the topic of your blog or website, you’ve found yourself a topic to cover and a new opportunity to generate more traffic and leads. Number of backlinks by page This metric shows the number of websites linking to your content piece. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are the most shareable and how your backlink profile compares to competitors’ profiles. Backlinks play a significant role in content ranking. That’s why, if you’re coming up with a new content piece, you should check the number of backlinks on top-ranking content for your seed keyword. Knowing the number will help you plan the link-building strategy for your piece. Whether you’re paying for backlinks or gathering them organically, it’s important to keep up with competitors. Backlinks Let’s take a more in-depth look at backlinks. There’s one important thing to remember: backlinks aren’t equal. The quality of the backlinks depends on the linking domain authority, URL strength, the amount of traffic generated by the linking domain, thematic fit, and more. For example, if you’re posting an article on content marketing dashboards (just like the one you’re reading), a backlink from HubSpot would have much more impact than a link from a regular guest-posting website for two main reasons: HubSpot is a trustworthy resource in the marketing field (authority + thematic fit). HubSpot most likely attracts more traffic. Ahrefs offers a lot of metrics to help you measure the backlink potential of different websites and assess the strength of your backlink profile. You can streamline this data to your content marketing dashboard to create a single source of truth for content marketing data. Avg. number of pages per session This metric shows how many pages your visitors view on average during a single session. By tracking this metric, you can identify which pieces of content are the most engaging and adjust your content strategy accordingly. Metrics for C-level Marketing Execs An example of a content marketing dashboard for C-level marketing execs Next up are higher-level metrics that can be used in general marketing reports presented to the board or CMOs/VPs of Marketing. Revenue attributed by content piece While all the metrics listed above indicate the effectiveness of your content in terms of ranking and SEO, CMOs usually focus on more tangible metrics, such as revenue. That’s why a report showing which content pieces bring the most revenue is crucial. MQLs attributed by content piece Tracking qualified leads is as important as tracking revenue. Instead of simply displaying the content pieces that bring the most leads, you can go further and break down those leads into groups. In this way, your dashboard will show which content pieces are popular among small businesses and which attract enterprises. You can use it to track the ROI of your content marketing efforts and adjust your content according to your target audience preferences. Digital velocity Digital velocity metrics show the speed at which accounts go from a lead to the closed/won stage. This indicator will help you understand which content pieces bring audiences that are more aware of your product and are more willing to buy it. Pipeline conversion rates This metric shows how many leads move through your sales pipeline and convert into paying customers. By tracking this metric, you can identify areas where your pipeline might get clogged and adjust your content strategy accordingly. How to Build a Content Marketing Dashboard Now that you know which metrics to include in your content marketing dashboard, let's look at how to build one. There are a few different ways to build a content marketing dashboard, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Build a content marketing dashboard with manually updated data Manual content marketing dashboard : pros and cons Spreadsheets are a tool that requires little to no technical knowledge. That's why they are so popular with most marketers. Teams often use spreadsheets as a single source of truth for their marketing activities. They have to populate tables with metrics gathered manually from different sources, and, unfortunately, that's not a very efficient or scalable way to build a content marketing dashboard. Here's why: Manual data collection: Collecting data from multiple sources and inputting it into a spreadsheet is time-consuming. Each data point has to be manually copied and pasted, which can result in errors and inconsistencies. Limited scalability: As your business grows and your data sources increase, manually updating a spreadsheet becomes more challenging. With more data points to track, it can quickly become overwhelming and difficult to manage. Plus, spreadsheets aren’t designed to be a database. When processing tens of thousand data rows, spreadsheets tend to stutter, freeze, or even crash regular office PCs. Lack of real-time insights: Manually updating a spreadsheet can result in a time delay in obtaining the most up-to-date information. As a result, it becomes impossible to make informed decisions when your data has a lag of a few days. Limited customization: A manually updated spreadsheet may not provide the flexibility and customization that some businesses need. They often lack in chart design capabilities and other features compared to visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI. Overall, building a content marketing dashboard using a spreadsheet and manually updated data may be a low-cost, entry-level solution. However, there are more efficient options for businesses that require comprehensive real-time insights. Build a DIY dashboard with API integrations API-based content marketing dashboard : pros and cons Another option to build a content marketing dashboard is using API integrations to pull data from different sources automatically. While this approach automates data collection, it also requires certain technical expertise and resources to maintain. The process of setting up APIs can be complicated, involving programming and review of each API’s documentation. To set up an API integration, developers need to understand API protocols, authentication methods, and endpoint documentation, among other technical aspects. This process can quickly turn into a large time suck and require additional resources to ensure the integrations are working correctly. What’s even more challenging is maintaining these APIs. Platforms roll out several updates per year for each of their APIs. Developers will also need to keep an eye on these changes, as they may require the codebase to be updated to keep the integration working properly. For instance, to extract data from Facebook Ads, marketers need to access Facebook's API documentation, obtain a Facebook app ID and secret key, and create an access token. This requires technical expertise and a clear understanding of the authentication process. Marketers also need to use the appropriate endpoints to extract the desired data, which can be complicated. And don’t even get me started on API deprecation, for example, a recent Adwords API sunset. Migrating your current infrastructure to a completely new API is a real pain in the neck. Furthermore, integrating multiple data sources can add a layer of complexity. To access data from different sources, developers must use other API protocols and ensure they are compatible. This may require more development resources, time, and cost. In summary, while building a content marketing dashboard with API integrations certainly automates your data workflow, it also requires technical expertise and considerable development resources. Use a third-party reporting tool One way to build a content marketing dashboard is to use a third-party reporting tool such as Whatagraph. It can be a quick and easy way to get a content marketing dashboard up and running. However, these tools often provide limited insights and lack the granularity required to achieve deeper insights out of raw numbers. Users typically have limited options for customizing the dashboard and may be limited to pre-built templates. While these tools may work for teams with limited resources or very basic reporting requirements, more advanced marketers may find them too basic and not customizable enough to meet their needs. Use automated marketing analytics platforms Automated marketing analytics platforms, like Improvado, provide a powerful solution to build a content marketing dashboard.

Tackling the platform and leveraging its power is vital to creating a solid, data-driven foundation on which to build your campaigns, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. All marketing teams understand the struggle of diving into so many reports with so little available time. If you’re feeling daunted by the task, you’re not alone—in 2022, 89% of marketers said they wanted to understand Google Analytics on a deeper level. One of the best ways to do this is to build a Google Analytics dashboard. In this article, you’ll learn the ins and outs of a Google Analytics dashboard, including which metrics to include to create a single source of truth for your marketing efforts. Uncover in-depth insights with customizable marketing dashboards BOOK A DEMO What Is a Google Analytics Dashboard? An analytics dashboard from Google is an all-in-one, centralized hub of visualizations that displays your website data in a clean, digestible way. You can customize the widgets showcasing the data to create your ideal overview. The best part? The dashboard displays real-time data that it automatically pulls from your site. You can choose to visualize your data in a variety of formats, including: Charts, Tables, Maps, Scorecards, And more. The alternative is sorting through thousands of rows of data to find the information you’re seeking. Obtaining essential data elements for decision-making can be a bloated, overwhelming, and time-consuming process. That’s why you need a dashboard. Dashboards deliver real-time, actionable data and organize it visually. Your analytics dashboard offers a quick overview of your KPIs and important metrics over a certain period of your choosing. This overview allows you to strategize effectively, take action, improve performance, and seize growth opportunities. Analytics dashboards will also play a critical role in collaborating with your team. Once you create your dashboard, it’s shareable with anyone in your organization. Having your most essential data and metrics displayed in a single location means you can ensure that everyone is on the same page and taking steps in the right direction. Discover 12 best marketing dashboard templates 5 Benefits of a Google Analytics Dashboard Most organizations prioritize knowing more about their site than just the traffic coming in. An effective dashboard pulls vital information from different sources and creates a visual display of end-to-end insights into your marketing funnel. That might include SEO, eCommerce, social media, and more. There are a variety of Google Analytics Dashboard templates and examples readily available to simplify your reporting efforts. Here are the top five benefits of using a Google Analytics Dashboard in your organization. 1. Customization A custom analytics dashboard can be incredibly beneficial for organizations. You can pull in data from your paid advertising, SEO content, social metrics, and more. Customization gives you total control over what you see and how you see it. 2. Centralization While having extensive reports laid out for you to dig into is valuable in specific circumstances, it’s better to have an overview of daily activity. The tricky thing about reports is that they’re often scattered across the various tools you use to keep your site healthy. Using a Google Analytics Dashboard provides maximum visibility into the most actionable metrics in a centralized location. All you have to do is log in and see the overview. 3. Transparency When running a marketing team, keeping everyone in the loop on what matters most can be challenging. With the ability to visualize actionable metrics in a single location, you may avoid slowed or delayed campaigns and miscommunication. A Google Analytics Dashboard offers transparency and accessible insights at any given time. 4. Channel Insights The marketing mix with which most companies work in our modern era is complicated. There are many channels to juggle and countless metrics to track. If you keep your analytics from each channel separate from each other, you’ll have difficulty getting an overview of your positioning. Google Analytics allows you to pull information from different marketing channels and compare them. The relationship between those channels may reveal some of your most vital data to make crucial decisions. 5. Funnel Visibility We touched on this before, but it can’t be stressed enough. Building a marketing funnel is one of the most important undertakings of a marketing executive. If you don’t make it trackable and measurable, it’s hard to take advantage of it. Using Google Analytics allows you to see into each stage of your funnel and find where the holes are. It’s also essential to determine how each stage of your funnel works and how it communicates with the others. The customer journey is a crucial conversation, and your data can give you a clear picture of it. (Try running a cohort analysis to see deeper into your funnel.) 5 Metrics to Include in a Google Analytics Dashboard Dashboards can come in various formats and serve different purposes. To create the proper visualization for your needs, you’ll want to include specific elements to keep the dashboard functional. If you’re starting out, these are five metrics you’ll want to track in a Google Analytics Dashboard. 1. Impressions An impression is when your website, ad, or content is found and loaded. Whenever you place content in front of people, that counts as an impression. This is an important metric to track to gain further insight into the extent of your reach. 2. Clicks Similarly, your clickthrough rate shows how often potential customers see your site and click through to visit it. Your clicks might come from paid or organic search rankings. 3. CPM Cost per thousand (CPM) is also known as cost per mile. It’s a term that indicates the cost of 1,000 ad impressions on a single web page. Tracking this metric can help you understand your positioning and what you’re paying for paid rankings. 4. Conversion Rate A metric you’re likely familiar with is your conversion rate—the number of people who visit your site or landing page and follow through with your CTA. Tracking your conversions is crucial because this number allows you to see whether or not your marketing efforts are paying off. 5. Top Keywords Tracking your top-performing keywords can be a great way to refine your overall marketing strategy. The 6 Types of Widgets in Google Analytics As we mentioned above, your Google Analytics Dashboard is a collection of widgets that displays real-time data from your website. Think of a widget as a mini-report that can showcase data in various ways. From simple numeric metrics to complete graphs, you have many options. Google Analytics allows you to define the functionality of your widgets within the dashboard itself. Each dashboard can have one or many widgets that display different dimensions and metrics. There are two main types of widgets in Google Analytics. The first is standard widgets, which show you processed data. These are updated whenever you refresh the page or alter the date range. ‍ The second type is real-time widgets. These are the bread-and-butter of your dashboard because, as the name suggests, they display your site data in real time. Real-time widgets update their metrics automatically for active website users. Depending on the widget, they can display Active User or Pageview metrics. Now that you’re equipped with the lay of the land, let’s jump into the types of widgets in Google Analytics. 1. Timeline Timeline is best suited for visualizing a selected metric over s period of time. A timeline can be either a standard or a real-time widget that displays a graph of the selected metric over a specified period. Typically, the metric uses connected dots to visualize progression or growth over months, weeks, or days (depending on your selections). If it’s a real-time widget, a timeline can display a graph of pageviews on your site for the last 60 seconds or the last 30 minutes. 2. Metrics Metric shows data as a single value number. Metrics are another form of standard widgets that show your data as a single value number. This perfect addition to your dashboard displays simple pieces of data in a clear way, such as daily or monthly active users. 3. Geo Map Geo maps are best suited for visualizing metrics tied to a specific region. The geomap can be either a standard or a real-time widget that visualizes Google Analytics metrics across an entire map or a selected region. If you’re trying to get an overview of users based on location, the geomap will allow you to get an accurate birds-eye view. 4. Bar Bar charts are best for comparing one or many categories of data. Bar widgets are standard widgets that can be useful for showcasing discrete or discontinuous data and showing the relationships between certain parts to the whole. This widget could be used to visualize and compare conversions coming from different traffic sources. 5. Pie Pie charts are best suited for visualizing the relationship between parts and the whole variable. Pie charts are standard widgets that display data as a percentage of the whole. This visualization can allow your team to visualize goal ratios by channels and other metrics that require understanding data contributions. 6. Tables Tables are best suited for displaying the correlation between metrics. A table can be either a standard or a real-time widget. It’s a classic display of data using rows and columns. Standard tables can display the correlation between metrics or provide a deeper look into a specific metric. Real-time tables can plot a table of active users against up to three selected dimensions. 3 Ways to Build a Dashboard from Google Analytics Data The number one benefit of building a dashboard from Google Analytics data is that you can easily see what’s working and what isn’t. A dashboard lets you drop unprofitable efforts and scale profitable ones. Of course, to see that level of success from your data, you’ll need to consider how you’re building your dashboard. These are three ways to get started. 1. Custom Google Analytics Dashboards Building a custom dashboard from scratch can be helpful if you know the exact metrics you want to track. If you’re coming into this with a preconceived plan, creating a custom dashboard will offer the flexibility and moldability you need to see the most critical metrics in a single view.

It can take a few tries to get it right, but eventually, you’ll see an overview of your critical data in a single space. 2.

How to build a Salesforce dashboard By creating and customizing Salesforce dashboards, businesses can maximize the value of their data by having all key metrics in one place. This section will provide an overview of how to build Salesforce dashboards and discuss three popular creation methods. Use Salesforce’s built-in dashboard functionality One of the most effective ways to build a Salesforce dashboard is to utilize the platform's built-in dashboard functionality. With various chart types available, including bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, funnel charts, scatter charts, tables, and cards, you can design a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that caters to your business needs. To start creating a dashboard in Salesforce, follow these steps: Prepare your reports: Before creating a dashboard, you must have your reports ready. Reports in Salesforce are the foundation of dashboards, as they provide the data visualized in the dashboard components. To create a report, navigate to the 'Reports' tab in Salesforce, click 'New Report,' and select the report type based on the data you want to analyze. Customize the report by adding filters, grouping, and sorting the data as needed. Save the report once it's complete. Navigate to Dashboards: Click on 'Dashboards' in the top menu. From there, you can edit an existing dashboard's components or create a new one. Create a new dashboard: To create a new dashboard, select the 'New Dashboard' option toward the top right. Customize your dashboard: Add components to your dashboard by clicking on 'Add Component.' Choose the appropriate chart type based on the data you want to visualize and the insights you want to communicate. Link each component to the relevant report you created in step 1. Save your dashboard: Once you have added and customized all the necessary components, save your dashboard. It's now ready for you and your team to view and analyze the data. Remember that building an effective Salesforce dashboard relies on your creativity and understanding of the data you're working with. Using Salesforce's built-in dashboard functionality, you can create visually appealing and informative dashboards that help your team monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. However, there are a few limitations to consider when using built-in Salesforce dashboards: Limited data sources: The built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality primarily supports data from the Salesforce platform. If you need to visualize data from external sources, you may face challenges integrating and displaying that information. Restricted customization options: While Salesforce offers a variety of chart types and components, the customization options may not be as extensive or flexible as those available in specialized data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau. Scalability issues: As your business grows and the complexity of your data increases, you might encounter limitations in the built-in Salesforce dashboard functionality, which could hinder your ability to create and manage multiple dashboards efficiently. Manual data management: Although Salesforce provides tools for managing and updating data, the process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially if you're working with large datasets or must combine data from multiple sources. By using a solution like Improvado, you can overcome these limitations. Improvado pulls data from 500+ sales and marketing data sources (including Salesforce) and aggregates disparate datasets with each other. This enables marketing and sales teams to build a holistic dashboard that provides clear-cut insights into the company’s revenue generation efforts. This way, you can maximize the potential of your dashboards and ensure that your team has access to the most accurate, comprehensive, and actionable insights into marketing and sales effort. Schedule a quick consultation to discuss your analytics goals and learn how Improvado can get you there. Create dashboards with Einstein Analytics Einstein Analytics is a tool within Salesforce that allows users to create interactive dashboards. By leveraging its different types of tables, including Values Table, Pivot Table, and Compare Table, users can go beyond traditional charts and widgets to provide more comprehensive insights into their data. To create a dashboard with Einstein Analytics, follow these steps: Navigate to the Einstein Analytics platform within Salesforce. Click ""Create"" and select ""Dashboard"" from the dropdown menu. Start by adding a chart, widget, or one of the three tables available in Einstein Analytics. Values Table: Provides supporting details for a chart, allowing users to drill down into the data. Pivot Table: Summarizes datasets and presents them from a different perspective, ideal for summary data. Compare Table: Allows for comparing different data types with unique filters for different columns. Customize the table or chart by applying filters, modifying the appearance, or adding interactivity through faceting or bindings. If needed, use Salesforce Analytics Query Language (SAQL) to modify the query further or make changes that can't be achieved through the point-and-click interface. Arrange your tables, charts, and widgets to create a visually appealing and insightful dashboard layout. Save the dashboard and share it with the relevant stakeholders. Although Einstein Analytics offers an effective way to create dashboards, there are some downsides to consider: Complexity: Due to its advanced features and capabilities, Einstein Analytics can be complicated to navigate for users without prior analytics or technical experience. This may lead to a steep learning curve for some team members.

Should you have an advertising strategy for LinkedIn? Is TikTok strictly for brands targeting Gen Z, or has it gone mainstream? Is Twitter still relevant in the wake of all the recent company changes? One platform many businesses have overlooked in recent years is Pinterest, a visually engaging platform bursting with potential. Pinterest has over 450 million monthly active users, and 45% of its US user base has a household income of over $100K. Shopping and link-clicking are common occurrences on the platform, and many people use the app specifically to get inspiration for purchases. If your brand decides to take the leap and advertise on Pinterest, you’ll need a Pinterest ads dashboard. When it comes to paid advertising, knowing how your campaigns are performing can help you optimize them for lower CPA and tweak messaging to attract more leads. This article offers an overview of Pinterest analytics and explains how you can visualize your Pinterest metrics in a cohesive and easily digestible way. What Are Pinterest Ads? Pinterest Ads dashboard : Pinterest user demographics Like many other social media platforms, Pinterest allows you to run paid ad campaigns. Since Pinterest is entirely visual, the ads are, too. That might mean custom infographics, digital designs, photography, or videos. Whatever your chosen visual medium, Pinterest ads can place your product or service in front of new audiences. Marketing on Pinterest is different from most social platforms. Unlike Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok, it’s much less focused on “social” interactions and more concentrated on the user experience. People use Pinterest to get inspired for a new project, to shop for their next purchase, and to curate and save content for personal consumption later. This might be a significant advantage for your brand. Research into Pinterest’s general audience insights shows that 83% of weekly users made a purchase based on the content they saw from brands on the platform. What should you take away from that? Well, Pinterest users aren’t always passive scrollers (as is more common on other social media apps). Most of the time, they seek inspiration from people and brands. Accelerate Pinterest analytics with Improvado’s dashboard BOOK A CALL The Basics of Pinterest Ads Analytics Paid advertising on Pinterest can be a great way to get your brand in front of more people. People often use search engines for online queries, but they’re also on social media for long periods. 59% of the world uses social media for an average of two and a half hours daily. Getting your ads on their feeds during that time can be incredibly valuable. Because the intention behind Pinterest differs from other platforms, there is some specific terminology to be aware of. Pin: A pin is a visual post on Pinterest. Usually, it’s an image, graphic, or video. You can think of pins like actual visuals you’d pin to a virtual corkboard, but more organized. Repins: When someone repins your pin, they’ve saved it to their own board(s). On other platforms, repins are often called “ saves.” Outbound clicks: Your ads will be pins with outbound links attached (probably your CTA). Outbound clicks are when users click into your pin and then through to your link. Pin clicks: Pins are displayed on Pinterest users’ feeds in a grid formation. To get a closer look, users can click on the pin itself. When they do, it’s counted as a pin click. ‍ Like any successful social media advertising campaign, you must keep tabs on how your ads perform. If done right, measuring social media data can significantly expand your business. Typically, marketers that run Pinterest campaigns use Pinterest’s in-app analytics. It’s a viable option if Pinterest is your primary advertising platform. Internal analytics shows you all the crucial metrics across all your pinterest campaigns. And, while this analytics solution grants a fairly deep level of visibility into Pinterest campaigns, it doesn’t show you how your Pinterest campaigns impact your overall cross-channel marketing efforts. A limited scope of Pinterest-specific metrics is usually insufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global marketing performance. Plus, built-in Pinterest dashboard isn’t compatible with a other platforms’ analytics tools, making it difficult to compare data across channels. Given that the Pinterest in-app analytics doesn’t provide the flexibility to create customized reports tailored to your marketing objectives, this solution lags far behind custom dashboards for cross-channel analysis. Of course, there are always marketers’ favorite spreadsheets. However, they quickly get complex and challenging to assemble and read when you start populating them with performance data from multiple platforms. So, what’s the most efficient solution to track Pinterest campaign performance and, at the same time, understand how they synergize with the rest of your marketing efforts? Enter the Pinterest ads dashboard. The Benefits of a Pinterest Ads Dashboard Improvado’s Pinterest Ads dashboard example A Pinterest ads dashboard is a marketing analytics tool that visually displays your Pinterest insights. Many people use marketing dashboards across multiple channels and platforms to visualize their KPIs and other crucial metrics. These dashboards provide an overview of everything you need to see about your paid advertising efforts in an easily digestible format. You can select any metrics you’d like to track and use visual graphs, charts, and more to display them. What’s even more important is that such a dashboard facilitates marketing performance tracking across different platforms and acts a single source of truth for all your cross-channel marketing efforts. There are several benefits to consider when building a dashboard, but here are the top three. 1. Enables Productivity The key to running a successful marketing team is generating more productivity without increasing workload; dashboards can do just that. A Pinterest ads dashboard automates data collection, transforms raw performance metrics into insights, and visualizes your insights to make them easily understandable for everyone. This takes a heavy weight off your team’s shoulders, allowing marketers to spend more time experimenting with new campaigns and analyzing insights instead of crunching numbers in spreadsheets. 2. Provides Greater Transparency Analytics dashboards create a central hub of information that anyone can use to guide their decisions and evaluate the marketing’s team performance. This makes it easier for different departments to stay on the same page and makes the marketing team more accountable for the ad spend and campaign performance. 3. Standardizes Metrics By aggregating data from various platforms, a custom dashboard can standardize metrics, enabling easy comparison of performance across channels. When gathering metrics manually, marketers have to remove duplicate data entries, verify that metrics’ naming conventions match each other, join disparate data tables, and more. An automated Pinterest Ads dashboard takes care of these tasks. By aggregating marketing data from Pinterest and other marketing platforms of your choice, you get a holistic view of your marketing efforts. Conversions that happened outside of Pinterest won’t slip away from your analytics and you can easily attribute each marketing dollar spent to a conversion, acquired traffic, or purchases. 4. Fuels Decision-Making Concrete data fuels successful strategies. Data collection and analysis is often a business bottleneck, but marketing dashboards simplify it. Custom Pinterest dashboards are designed to include advanced analytical tools, such as attribution modeling, forecasting, and trend analysis, which provide deeper insights into marketing performance. You can use your insights from your Pinterest ads dashboard to improve campaigns and strategies.

Schedule a call 7 Metrics to Track in a Pinterest Ads Dashboard Your dashboard won’t be helpful to your team without the proper metrics. Take time to identify your KPIs for specific campaigns and decide which to include in your dashboard. Here are a few to get you started. 1. Impressions Tracking your impressions on Pinterest is important, as it tells you how many people have viewed your ads. At its core, impressions are a vital metric that says a lot about your campaign health. For example, if an ad is generating a high number of impressions but not converting well, you may need to reassess your targeting or creative strategy. Conversely, if an ad is generating fewer impressions but converting well, you might consider increasing its budget to reach a larger audience. Besides, impressions serve as a basis for calculating other important engagement metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), engagement rate, and cost per impression (CPI). By measuring these metrics, you can gain insights into how well your audience is interacting with your ads, helping you optimize your campaigns for better results. 2. Click-Through Rate (CTR) Your CTR lets you know how many users click on your pins and then click through to your outbound links. A higher CTR indicates that your ad is resonating well with your target audience, encouraging them to take action. Monitoring CTR helps you gauge the effectiveness of your ad creatives, headlines, and CTAs.This is vital information for tracking the conversion path. Additionally, platforms like Pinterest use ad performance metrics, including CTR, to determine the quality of your ads. A higher CTR may lead to a higher quality score, which in turn can result in better ad placements and lower costs. 3. Cost-Per-Click (CPC) Paid advertising can be pricey, so keeping tabs on your ads' costs is essential. Your CPC will tell you how much each click costs you. When compared to the other metrics on the dashboard, the CPC can help you decide the value of that price. And, what’s more, monitoring CPC allows you to calculate your return on ad spend by comparing the revenue generated from conversions to the cost of acquiring those clicks. This information is crucial for determining the overall profitability of your ad campaigns and making data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing strategy. Also, Tracking CPC helps you assess your campaign performance in relation to your competitors. By monitoring industry benchmarks and comparing your CPC to industry averages, you can determine if your ads are performing well within your niche and identify areas for improvement. Pinterest’s CPC averages $0.5 - $1.5 per click, so keep this in mind when measuring your CPC. 4. Cost-Per-Mile (CPM) Similarly, your CPM tells you how much 1,000 impressions costs. This metric can help provide a big-picture view of the ROI of your campaign. CPM is directly related to your bidding strategy. By tracking CPM, you can identify if your bid is too high or too low, allowing you to adjust your bids to find the optimal balance between cost and visibility. Average CPM on Pinterest lies in the range of $2 - $5 per thousand impressions. 5. Ad Spend Ad Spend tells you how much you’re spending on your paid advertising overall. Regularly tracking ad spend allows you to detect any sudden spikes in costs or anomalies in your campaigns. Identifying these issues early on enables you to make adjustments to prevent overspending and maintain control over your advertising budget. Also, by monitoring ad spend over time, you can identify seasonal trends or shifts in your target audience's behavior. This information can help you adjust your campaigns accordingly to capitalize on these trends and improve your campaign performance. 6. Engagement Rate This metric is crucial to understanding the success of your campaigns. It can include data such as repins, comments, likes, and more. Ads with high engagement rates are more likely to be saved or shared by users, increasing the potential for virality and extending the reach of your campaigns organically. Tracking engagement rate can help you identify ads with high viral potential and optimize your campaigns to maximize organic reach. Besides, you can tweak you content strategy for ad campaigns depending on the type of content that performs best (video, photos, images with texts, etc.). 7. Conversion Rate Tracking conversions is a critical part of any marketing campaign, and it isn’t any different on Pinterest. Your conversion rate tells you how many ad views convert into customers. Drive Higher ROAS with an Improvado-Built Pinterest Ads Dashboard As it comes clear, there are multiple ways to track Pinterest Ads performance, and all of them have their upsides and downsides. Creating a custom cross-channel dashboard including Pinterest analytics data is the best way to keep track of your marketing performance, enable internal and cross-departmental collaboartion, and automate the analytics process.

TikTok Ads Dashboard: Best Practices and KPIs In 2019 and 2020, TikTok may have ignited a brand-new social media revolution by becoming one of the most popular apps in the world. The platform caught fire during the global pandemic and became a household name seemingly overnight. Initially, people used TikTok for memes and dancing videos, but today it’s become one of the largest social media platforms with the highest engagement rates among competitors. Marketers still trying to figure out Facebook ads when TikTok hit likely felt overwhelmed. Another social media account to manage? The feeling is valid, but TikTok is a whole new dimension for your company’s marketing stack. Running ads on TikTok can be especially beneficial, and if you choose to do so, you’ll need a TikTok ads dashboard to measure your success. This article will teach you the basics of TikTok ad analytics and how to build your custom dashboard. Get a TikTok Ads dashboard to streamline efficiency of your TikTok efforts BOOK A CALL Introducing TikTok Ads TikTok has a colorful history and a flourishing user base. The app boasts over 1 billion monthly active users (as of the last quarter of 2022), many of whom are younger Millennials and Generation Z. For brands trying to target those demographics, TikTok is the place to be. TikTok ads work in much the same way as other social media platforms. Short-form video content is all that TikTok displays on their users’ feeds, so you can create TikTok ads in that format and sponsor them to reach your target audience. Running TikTok ad campaigns is an excellent way to extend your current reach. Many social platforms allow you to tailor your ad campaigns to specific audiences, and TikTok is no exception, though they do have a surprisingly robust offering in this department. You can target viewers based on interests, demographics, and behaviors. TikTok Ads dashboard : location targeting TikTok Ads location targeting options From there, you can present your ad in viewers’ “For You” feed, which is the curated selection of videos TikTok’s algorithm displays to users continuously. What Kinds of Ads Can You Run on TikTok? TikTok offers different types of paid advertising. The three main options are: In-feed ads TikTok Ads dashboard : in-feed ads This 9–15 second vertical ad on users’ “For You” page can also include a call to action (CTA). In-feed ads are the most common type of ad on TikTok. With the help of a clickable CTA button you can drive traffic towards external landing pages, app download pages, or to your organization’s TikTok account. In-feed ads are a great opportunity to grab prospects’ attention. 68% of users find Ads on TikTok unique and different from any other platform. Plus, these ads are undistinguishable from regular TikTok content, with a CTA being the only difference between two types of content. So, you have a chance to advertise your product or tell a story about your brand without users recognizing that it was an actual ad. However, if your ad creative isn’t engaging enough or is overly salesy, users will most likely skip it immediately. That’s why you have to follow TikTok trends and fit into the feed with the right content to ensure the campaign’s success. Brand takeover ads TikTok Ads dashboard : brand takeover ads With these ads, your video plays when a targeted user opens the app. If interested in your offering, they can click the ad, which will take them to your landing page. TikTok ensures users see only one brand takeover ad daily, limiting these positions. While brand takeover ads are certainly effective for raising awareness of your brand, product, or event, they might not be the best choice for TikTok Ads first timers because of their high price. Hashtag challenges TikTok Ads dashboard : hashtag challenges‍ Branded hashtag challenges are an advertising opportunity unique to TikTok, which makes your ads more exciting and engaging. These challenges prompt users to create videos showing themselves performing a specific action. This type of ad allows you to harness the power of User-Generated Content (UGC) and drive more awareness, leads, or credibility for your brand. The main advantage of the branded hashtag challenge is the potential scale and reach of your campaign. If executed properly, millions of users can catch the trend and create content that benefits your brand. It’s impossible to achieve with regular influencer campaigns for example. This type of ad also boasts of 17 times higher engagement rates compared to regular campaigns across other platforms. TikTok does offer some additional options, but these three are the most commonly used. How Much Do TikTok Ads Cost? The cost of these ads will vary depending on the ad type, budget, targeting, and other factors. However, due to the nature and popularity of the app, it’s often more expensive than other social platforms like Facebook or Instagram. For example, regular in-feed ads start at 10$ per CPM. Besides, you have to spend at least $500 per campaign to advertise on TikTok. As per other ad types, TikTok hasn’t been very transparent about the cost of advertising. However, marketers and influencers claim that a brand takeover campaign that ensures 5 mln+ impressions starts from $50,000 per day. The hashtag challenge might cost you $150,000 per week. What Is a TikTok Ads Dashboard? Improvado’s example of a TikTok Ads dashboard Reporting is an integral part of advertising on TikTok. Whether you need to measure the impact of your finished campaigns or optimize some of the ongoing ones, you always need to dive into performance metrics first. Typically, reporting isn’t on the marketer’s high-priority list of tasks. They often copypaste metrics in a spreadsheet to get a high-level overview of the campaign’s performance. Then, everything is pretty straightforward. If the campaign’s ROAS is positive, the team launches it again. If the ROAS is negative, they ditch the campaign and come up with something new. However, a coherent reporting is crucial for TikTok Ads for several reasons: TikTok ad performance is harder to measure compared to regular display ads. For example, UGC campaigns usually take more time to deliver results, so marketers have to keep sharp eye on metrics and don’t jump to conclusions. Large-scale TikTok campaigns are expensive, so teams have to take them responsibly and keep track of their marketing dollars. That’s where a TikTok ads dashboard comes in. Picture this: A single source of truth for performance data across all campaignsthat displays all KPIs in a visual, easily digestible format. Charts and graphs make it much easier to understand the results campaigns achieve and facilitate better communication. TikTok In-App Analytics vs. Cross-Channel Dashboards TikTok Ads in-app analytics Naturally, many marketers rely on TikTok’s in-app dashboard. It’s an automatic report with real-time updates and fundamental insights into your account. For marketing teams that use TikTok as their primary acquisition channel, this report might be enough. It shows all the crucial metrics and provides shows you what’s working and what’s not with your TikTok campaigns. However, things become much more complex when you have to report on performance across different ad platforms, website, paid search, and other channels. For example, your TikTok campaign sends prospects to your website after they click on your ad. TikTok’s in-app dashboard will only record the number of clicks generated by the campaign. If you need to go further and know how many visitors from your TikTok campaign turned into customers, you’ll have to check this data in Google Analytics or any other web analytics tool you use. In case you’re running ads across multiple platforms, you’ll have to use each platform’s dashboard and compare it with your web analytics data. Given that in-app dashboards often show metrics biased towards their platforms, the entire reporting process might turn into a nightmare. A cross-channel dashboard can save you 90% of the time you spend on manual reporting and protect you from invalid data that often pops up while drawing up your report manually. Marketing analytics platforms are designed to handle cross-channel reporting. Improvado, a leading platform for marketing and sales reporting, connects data from 500+ marketing and sales platforms to build a cross-channel dashboard tailored to your use case. It allows you to prioritize marketing analytics by streamlining all manual reporting activities.

You can connect TikTok Ads, Facebook, Instagram, and any other platform to see which platforms, campaigns, or creatives drive conversions and help you reach your goals.Schedule a quick call with Improvado’s experts to know how you can level up you marketing analytics toolkit. ‍ What Metrics to Include in a TikTok Ads Dashboard Being strategic about the metrics you include in your dashboard is essential. Building a custom TikTok dashboard is more of an investment than using in-app analytics, so you want to extract maximum value from it. Here are some essential TikTok metrics and KPIs to get you started. Impressions You should include this standard metric on every dashboard. Impressions measure the number of people to whom you’ve exposed your ad. Keep in mind that TikTok users often scroll endlessly, so they might see your ad several times, and each of these are counted as individual impressions. Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) Many brands forget to track their ROAS, but you shouldn’t overlook this crucial metric. You can consider it a more specific extension of your ROI, as it measures the value of your ad spend dollars. Click-Through Rate (CTR) Your click-through rate measures the number of users that clicked on an ad to your landing page or desired external link. It's important to track this metric to gauge the effectiveness of your ads in driving traffic to your target destination. Dashboards display this data as a line chart to visualize trends over time. Cost Per Click (CPC) CPC on TikTok works the same as it does on other platforms. How much are clicks costing you on the platform? This metric lets you know. Conversion Rate (CR) Tracking your conversion rate is essential on every single platform you use for marketing. It’s arguably the most critical metric since it tells you how many impressions you’ve converted into customers. View Time This one shows the total time users spend watching your ads. It's important because it indicates how engaging your ads are to your target audience. View time is usually presented using a line chart to track changes in view time over a period, which can help identify trends and potential areas for improvement. Video Completion Rate (VCR) VCR measures the percentage of users who watched the entire ad. This metric indicates the effectiveness of the ad in retaining viewers' attention. VCR can be displayed as a percentage on a bar chart to easily compare different ads' performance. Engagement Rate The total number of actions (likes, comments, shares) on your ad divided by the number of views. A high engagement rate indicates that the ad is resonating with the audience. You can present engagement rate as a percentage on a bar chart to compare the performance of various ads. Cost per Engagement (CPE) CPE is the average cost of each engagement (like, comment, share) on your ad. Monitoring CPE helps to ensure your ads are generating valuable interactions at an acceptable cost. A line chart is ideal for tracking CPE over time and identifying trends. Bounce Rate It’s not exactlyTikTok Ads metrics, but a crucial web analytics Bounce rate is the percentage of users who clicked on your ad but left your website after viewing only one page. A high bounce rate could indicate that the ad is not effectively targeting the right audience. Display bounce rate as a percentage on a bar chart to compare the performance of different ads. Automate TikTok Ads Dashboards and Reports With Improvado Manual reporting and data entry takes much of your team’s time and resources.

Twitter reports that users “spend 26% more time viewing ads on Twitter than they do on other leading platforms,” so when managed well, Twitter advertising has the potential to drive a solid ROI. To measure the performance of your Twitter PPC campaigns, you need a Twitter Ads dashboard. This article will teach you more about data visualization and how to approach paid advertising from a data-driven perspective. Key Takeaways Twitter Ads is a paid advertising platform that allows you to sponsor posts to reach a larger audience.

Twitter Ads work similarly to paid advertising options on other social platforms. With Twitter Ads, you can reach a wider audience by paying to promote your tweets. Twitter also allows advertisers to target specific users. By setting your ad campaigns to reach those that share your ideal audience's interests, demographics, and behaviors, you can generate leads from social media in a more precise and targeted way, increasing your odds of a positive ROI. Twitter Ads allow you to promote a range of content, including: Tweets Videos Images Leveraging data is essential if you want to optimize your Twitter Ads performance. The question is: How do you view that data? This is where a Twitter Ads Dashboard can prove useful. What Is a Twitter Ads Dashboard? Improvado’s Twitter Ads dashboard example A Twitter Ads dashboard is a marketing dashboard that visually displays your Twitter Ads data. This tool can display the essential metrics and KPIs for your paid ad campaigns, which you can use to create actionable strategies. When you input metrics into a Twitter analytics dashboard, you can easily track how your ads are performing. Your dashboard can offer insight into: Ad Delivery—Are the ads reaching the target audience? Ad Performance—Is the level of engagement high or low? Which campaigns are performing the best? Cost—What is the current ad spend? Using a dashboard to showcase your metrics helps to provide insights you can use to develop better marketing strategies or determine whether Twitter is the right channel for your paid advertising. You’ll be able to see if your campaigns are converting impressions to customers. Choosing the Right Visualization Type for Twitter Ads Dashboard When creating a Twitter Ads dashboard, it's important to choose the right visualization type for each metric you want to track. The right visualization can help you identify trends and insights more easily, making it easier to optimize your campaigns for maximum ROI. Here are some examples of visualizations that could be used in a Twitter Ads dashboard: Line charts Line charts are a great way to visualize changes in a metric over time. For example, you could use a line chart to track changes in ad spend over the course of a month or quarter. This could help you identify trends in spending and adjust your budget accordingly. Heat maps CTR heat map for a Twitter Ads dashboard‍ Heat maps are useful for visualizing geographic data. Heat maps might be used to visualize where ads are getting the most engagement. This could help you target your ads more effectively in specific regions. Bar charts Bar charts are useful for comparing different metrics side-by-side. For example, you could use a bar chart to compare the click-through rates (CTR) of different ad variations. This could help you identify which ads are performing best and adjust your campaigns accordingly. Scatter Plots Engagement scatter plot for a Twitter Ads dashboard‍ Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two metrics.Hence, you can visualize the relationship between ad spend and post likes with the help of a scatter plot. This could help you identify whether there is a correlation between these two metrics and adjust your spending accordingly. When choosing a visualization type, it's important to consider the type of data you're working with and the insights you want to uncover. For example, if you want to identify trends over time, a line chart may be the best option. If you want to compare different metrics, a bar chart may be more effective. It's also important to choose a visualization type that is easy to read and understand, as this will help you communicate your insights to other stakeholders. Top 3 Benefits of a Twitter Ads Dashboard Twitter reporting can be challenging because there are many key metrics to sort through. A dashboard solves that issue by streamlining and visualizing your data, making it easier to digest and report. Stakeholders grasp the results easier when in-house or outsourced marketing teams provide visuals. Beyond that, there are many other advantages to using a Twitter Ads dashboard. Here are the top three benefits of implementing a data visualization tool into your workflow. 1. Improved Decision-Making Businesses across all industries understand the importance of data-driven strategies. Having a constant feedback loop that’s visual, accessible, and user-friendly makes it easy to dive into data regularly. 2. Increased Efficiency Having a centralized data hub for your marketing channels is a game changer. Your team and stakeholders can access the same information at any time of day or night. This makes communication more efficient and strategy sessions more productive. If you automate the data collection process, you’ll take things further and eradicate manual reporting. Automated dashboards can save your team 27% of their time. 3. Greater Transparency Transparency fosters trust and a better awareness of results. Stakeholders (clients or higher-ups) not recognizing a campaign’s ROI is a common frustration for marketing teams. It can be easy to miss a few critical KPIs when combing through lengthy and complex spreadsheets. A Twitter Ads dashboard provides greater transparency across teams and facilitates more efficient communication. Why Built-In Twitter Analytics is Less than Ideal Drawbacks of built-in Twitter Ads analytics Even though In-App Twitter analytics shows a lot of information regarding your Twitter Ads performance, it often fails to demonstrate a bigger picture of your marketing performance. Let’s figure out why this happens and what can be done to change it. Limited Cross-Channel Visibility Twitter's in-app analytics only allows for analysis of data generated within the Twitter platform. This means that you can only see data related to your Twitter Ads campaigns and how they are performing within the Twitter platform. The reason for this limitation is that Twitter isn’t designed to be a marketing analytics tool. You can’t consolidate data from different sources in Twitter Ads Manager. Consequently, if you are running ads on Twitter and Facebook, you would need to use two in-app analytics tools to get a grasp of your marketing performance. Twitter's in-app analytics would only show you data related to your Twitter Ads campaigns, while Facebook's analytics tool would only show you data related to your Facebook Ads campaigns. There are certain differences in how each platform collects and analyzes data. Each platform maps data differently, has different naming conventions for their metrics, and a whole lot of other other differences. As a result, teams turn to using spreadsheets as a quick way to aggregate all performance metrics. More advanced marketing teams leverage marketing analytics platforms to consolidate marketing reporting. For example, enterprise-level teams use Improvado to automate their marketing analytics. Improvado integrates with 500+ marketing and sales platforms to pull together all your performance data and create a holistic picture of marketing performance. The platform transforms your insights into a cohesive, easily-digestible format that makes data readily available for analysis.

Ineffective Marketing Attribution If you’re running campaigns across multiple platforms and drive acquired traffic to yourwebsite, you probably understand how crucial it is to have a proper attribution process in place. Without it, you can’t understand which campaigns result in conversions and revenue, and which of them should optimized to get better results. Unfortunately, native Twitter analytics tools doesn’t allow for effective marketing attribution. Yes, Twitter offers its own tracking pixel for website conversion tracking. However, it has some significant drawbacks. First of all, it’s yet another piece of custom code that you have to implement on your website. Considering that you already have Google Analytics tracking pixel, custom events, and various third-party software (e.g., a live chat app), Twitter Pixel will only degrade your website performance and increase webpage loading time. Secondly, Twitter Pixel is somewhat biased towards Twitter. Meaning, it might attribute more conversions to Twitter Ads than it really influenced. It’s nothing new that discrepancies often occur between Google Analytics and ad vendors third-party tracking solutions. And the reason for these discrepancies is that tracking pixels aren’t 100% precise and straightforward. That’s why it’s better to aim for marketing analytics platforms that don’t require additional tracking pixels. For example, Improvado seamlessly integrates with your existing web analytics platform to track journeys and build user profiles. You can use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or any other pixel directly with Improvado.

Schedule a call What Metrics to Include in a Twitter Ads Report Your dashboard is only as effective as the metrics you put into it. Being intentional about which metrics to include is essential to gaining the most value from your dashboard. ‍ Here are a few metrics to consider. Ad Clicks As the name suggests, Ad Clicks count the number of times users click on your ads. Ad Spend The Ad Spend metric monitors how much money you’ve spent on paid ads. You can filter this data based on specific ad variations, campaign(s), or ad sets. Click-Through Rate (CTR) Your CTR is an essential metric for comparing the number of clicks your ad link received vs. the number of impressions. If your ad receives a lot of impressions (views) but only a few clicks, this could mean something is off with your campaign targeting. Cost Per Mille (CPM) Another valuable metric to track is your CPM, which tracks the cost of 1,000 ad impressions. Post Likes Though some might feel that likes are merely a vanity metric, they can be helpful to track if you’re looking to quantify engagement. You can measure the number of likes a specific tweet receives, or a designated set of tweets. Content Engagement Content Engagement offers a more holistic perspective by measuring all engagement results from your Twitter profile. How to Simplify Twitter Ads Tracking and Dashboard Creation Manual reporting and data collection is a pain in the neck for every marketing team. While performance measurement is fundamental for every healthy marketing campaign, the time it takes to draw up a report renders the entire marketing analytics process unviable. However, it doesn’t have to be that way. You can automate the process and get insightful cross-channel dashboards with real-time data. Improvado streamlines data from 500+ sources (including a Twitter Ads integration). Then, it cleans your data from duplicates and any redundant data entries that are common when exporting data via third-party APIs.

How To Build A Comprehensive Amazon Ads Dashboard & What Metrics to Include Whether you’re a marketer for an Amazon seller or an agency managing the ad spend of multiple Amazon storefronts, understanding Amazon advertising data is critical. As many marketers know, Amazon is one of the most competitive online platforms. That’s why paying for sponsored ads on product listings is often necessary to stand above the competition. Using an Amazon ads dashboard can fuel your efforts to make data-driven decisions about your sponsored listing spend. Understanding SEO, targeting, and sponsored product reports can be daunting for in-house marketing teams and agencies. It’s often difficult to discern the accuracy of your data across multiple report types. An in-depth understanding of these reports is essential to managing pay-per-click (PPC) spending on Amazon’s platform and making strategic decisions. This article will review building a comprehensive Amazon ads dashboard to cut through the noise and improve your marketing strategy. Key Takeaways PPC advertising is critical to success on Amazon. Amazon Advertising is a platform helping sellers and marketers manage their Amazon PPC ads (including sponsored listings, brands, and more). All businesses should use a dashboard to visualize their Amazon advertising data for greater visibility and ROI. Some key metrics to track on your Amazon ads dashboard include clicks, impressions, the average cost of sales (ACoS), return on ad spend (ROAS), sales, and ad spend. Improvado can help your business drive higher ROAS by automating your Amazon Ads analytics. Jumpstart your Amazon Ads analytics with Improvado BOOK A CALL The Basics of Amazon Advertising Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is one of the most crucial elements of an effective Amazon advertising campaign. While optimizing your product listings for higher organic search positions is a right thing to do, they often don’t jump to higher positions overnight. Following SEO best practices alone won’t get your listing to the top. You also need to have a competitive amount of sales and reviews from verified users to rank higher. That’s why investing marketing dollars into a solid paid strategy can help you generate new sales and, at the same time, improve your listings’ search positions. Sponsored product listings can be expensive—especially if you don’t know how to allocate your spending and plan your campaign correctly. This is where Amazon analytics is handy for sellers and marketers of all sizes. Understanding the basics of Amazon advertising can help you create a good PPC campaign. Learning how to create a comprehensive data dashboard allows you to visualize the results of your campaigns. Before we dive into the details, let’s touch on what Amazon advertising is. Essentially, it’s an umbrella term used to label all of the platform’s advertising solutions, and it can be broken into two categories: 1. Self-Service Amazon PPC: These are advertisements you pay for to appear on Amazon itself. In other words, these include your sponsored product listings, which are most likely the type of sponsored content you care about the most. Brand Registered and otherwise professional sellers trying to extend their reach and expand their audience use PPC ads. Amazon’s PPC ads are the most common advertising on the platform. Besides sponsored product listings, they include sponsored brands and sponsored display ads. 2. Managed-Service Amazon DSP: These advertisements are shown on Amazon’s platform and across the web. They’re CPM ads, or cost per thousand impressions. This self-managed platform is offered to sellers who sell on Amazon and those who don’t, but want access to Amazon’s data on customer purchasing behavior to more precisely target their advertising. These types of advertisements typically require a large budget and dedicated support from an Amazon Advertising account executive. From there, they can help you set up an Amazon DSP service. This article will discuss Amazon Ads, or Amazon Advertising (not Seller Central, which is for managing your Amazon store). Amazon Advertising is designed to help you manage your Amazon PPC ads (including all sponsored listings, brands, and more). How Does Amazon PPC Work? PPC stands for pay-per-click, meaning you pay Amazon every time a potential customer clicks on your Amazon ad. Mind that you’re only paying for a click. If the prospect clicks on your listing and doesn’t purchase you still have to pay for this click. You can set up any PPC ad campaign in just a few minutes. The cost of the campaign, however, depends on the type of ad you’re placing, which keywords you’re targeting, and how competitive the market is. When planning and executing a PPC campaign on Amazon, you must keep track of crucial metrics. Luckily, this is where Amazon pulls through with provided metrics to help you track each campaign’s success. One of the best ways to know how your advertising efforts influence Amazon sales is to visualize marketing data on an Amazon ads dashboard. What Is an Amazon Ads Dashboard? Using a marketing dashboard to visualize your data is one of the best ways to internalize and interact with meaningful metrics. An Amazon ads dashboard is a marketing dashboard you can build to display all required metrics in a visually engaging, easily digestible way. Think of your Amazon ads dashboard as a central information hub. Whether you’re a marketing agency that needs to deliver reports to your clients selling on Amazon or an in-house marketing team with an Amazon seller, you need a dashboard. Dashboards make it easy to share information and report the results of marketing efforts. Essentially, dashboards make reporting on Amazon ads a breeze.

Amazon Ads dashboard: sales growth dynamics In theory, Amazon Ads dashboard can help you find lots of unobvious trends and significantly improve ROI of your ppc campaigns. However, the dashboard is not a panacea. It’s crucial to understand which areas of your Amazon marketing it can improve to avoid overexpectations. So, let’s dive into areas that can be improved with an Amazon dashboard. It helps you get measurable results One of the most frustrating parts about marketing is quantifying your results. When stakeholders and clients ask about their spending, they want concrete evidence that their investment is effective. Many marketing teams still rely on spreadsheets to communicate, but those can be lengthy and confusing. A dashboard lays out the most critical data and metrics in a clean, straightforward way leading to actionable insights. Your clients and stakeholders won’t have to scroll through endless spreadsheets without understanding the effects of marketing efforts. Everyone will be on the same page. It enables collaboration across team members The same goes for your internal team. Implementing a dashboard allows for more effective internal communication. When you tell your team members a particular metric is part of a common goal, they’ll visualize that metric’s relationship to the whole. It makes your analytics more effective Instead of relying on sales and revenue as your primary success metrics, you can dive into more granular indicators. CTR, impressions, cumulative reach, keyword search volume, and loads of other metrics can help you get actionable insights into every campaign you launch. With different levels of granularity you can easily compile a high-level overview for stakeholders as well as optimize campaigns based on derived insights from low-level data. Overall, using an Amazon ads dashboard is critical to your overall success. When you use a dashboard, you benefit from greater transparency, clear picture of your ROI, in-depth insights into your audience behavior and buying intent, and more. What Metrics to Include in an Amazon Ads Report Now that you’ve decided to use an Amazon ads dashboard, you must know how to populate it. Amazon Ads, as well as any other platform, offers quite a lot of metrics you can track. And, this often leads to a question “What am I looking at?”. So, selecting the right metrics is crucial to make the dashboard informative, and, at the same time, concise. Below are some of the most universally beneficial Amazon Advertising metrics to track on your dashboard report. Having a firm grasp on these metrics can help you set goals, strategize, and gain a competitive edge with your ad campaigns. Impressions You might be familiar with impressions metrics from your Google PPC ads or social media advertising, which work in essentially the same way on Amazon. Impressions will show how many times Amazon displayed your ad to a customer. Clicks This critical metric shows how often someone has clicked on your Amazon ad. If the idea of invalid clicks enters your mind, Amazon is one step ahead. They adjust the report for invalid clicks (accidental or otherwise) within three days, which is immensely helpful for accurate reporting. Average Cost of Sales (ACoS) Amazon Ads dashboard: how to calculate ACoS This valuable metric measures the effectiveness of your sponsored ads. It represents the percentage of ad-generated sales spent through advertising. ACoS is one of those metrics that will go a long way with clients and stakeholders. It provides a quantifiable number to show them the value of their dollar. How to Manually Calculate ACoS To calculate your ACoS, divide the amount you spent on ads by how much revenue your ads generated. In other words, if you spent $100 on advertising, and it brought in one sale of $200, your ACoS would be 50%. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) Monitoring your ROAS has several benefits, especially for understanding the efficiency of your campaigns. Whenever a company engages in new marketing efforts, a crucial question is whether that investment is worth it. Marketing dollars are worth it when they drive additional revenue, which is precisely what this metric determines. What is the value of your marketing dollars, and specifically your ad spend dollars? How to Manually Calculate ROAS ROAS is the inverse of the ACoS metric: if you have a ROAS of 6, that means that for every dollar you spent on ads, you collected $6 in revenue. Sales The sales report shows the number of product sales generated within a week of ad clicks. A good Amazon Ads dashboard allows you to track sales across different regions, demographics of your buyers, and more. Here’s an example of Improvado’s dashboard with sales breakdown by different states: Amazon Ads dashboard: sales breakdown by regions Ad Spend Another clear metric is spend, which tells you how much you invest in a particular ad campaign. Ad spend equals the total number of click charges per product ad.

One has only to compare ROI of influencer marketing with other forms of advertising. For example, a recent study showed that influencer campaigns have 11X the ROI of display ads. However, influencer campaigns quickly form a tangled web of dull performance metrics that is hard to comprehend on your own. Large brands collaborate with hundreds of influencers across different platforms and regions, and often without a single source of truth for performance tracking. With metrics scattered across different spreadsheets and influencer hubs, it's difficult to determine whether your strategy is driving the desired results or not. An influencer marketing dashboard serves as a command center for all influencer-related activities providing a comprehensive view of your campaigns' performance. In this article, we'll explore how to build an influencer marketing dashboard, what metrics to track, and how to use gathered data to make better marketing decisions. If you're a marketing manager looking to optimize your influencer marketing strategy, keep reading to learn how an influencer marketing dashboard can help you measure the impact of your influencer campaigns and improve your overall marketing performance.

Book a consultation with an Improvado expert to see what it can do for your agency. Who Should Use an Influencer Marketing Dashboard? Analyzing Influencer marketing performance by different channels Marketers use influencer marketing dashboards to measure the campaign performance across different platforms First, we need to determine the roles across the organization that can benefit from an influencer marketing dashboard. Normally, all revenue team members should check the influencer marketing dashboard once in a while if influencer marketing is the company’s primary demand generation channel. Marketing Managers Marketing managers should be checking the influencer dashboard on a daily basis. They are responsible for the strategy, messaging, and values conveyed by influencers. Hence, dashboard metrics show whether their campaigns focus on the right audience and how effective their messaging is. Comparing performance with industry benchmarks allows to spot improvement opportunities and tweak campaigns accordingly. Here’s our social media engagement rate forecast for 2023. Learn how your campaigns compare to platforms’ averages. Influencer Partnership Managers Influencer partnership managers are responsible for building and maintaining relationships with influencers. They can use an influencer dashboard to track the performance of each influencer, evaluate their impact on the company’s bottom line, and determine whether they are meeting their contractual obligations. Performance Marketers Unlike most influencer campaigns that focus on building brand awareness, influencer performance marketers prioritize client acquisition. 71% of marketers agree that the quality of customers and traffic from influencer marketing is better than other sources, like email or social media campaigns. Just like with regular display advertising, performance marketers provide influencers with trackers and creatives they place on their public pages and integrate into their content. The influencer marketing dashboard displays data captured by those trackers to help performance marketers identify individual influencers, creatives, and messages that generate more clients and result in lower customer acquisition costs. Sales Teams Sales and marketing alignment can bring invaluable benefits to businesses, and influencer marketing provides a targeted and affordable alternative to expensive advertising campaigns. For instance, 2 Degrees Food, a San Francisco-based food company, uses influencer marketing to leverage peer-to-peer and word of mouth advertising as part of their growth strategy, instead of investing in costly TV commercials. In case influencer marketing is your main source of acquisition, incorporating UTM tags or other trackers into your influencer marketing dashboard is crucial to let your salespeople know the prospects' intent. Let’s say, your company offers two different products and launches two separate influencer campaigns to promote them. Storing the name of your product in the ‘utm_campaign’ parameter provides your sales team with more context into the prospects’ intent and needs. In this way, salespeople can structure their presentation according to the product the prospect is interested in to target their pains more effectively. CMOs and Marketing Executives CMOs and other marketing executives can use an influencer dashboard to evaluate the impact of influencer marketing on revenue generation and understand how it compares to other marketing activities. Keeping an eye on ROI, engagement, and brand awareness metrics allows them to determine whether their influencer marketing campaigns drive the desired results. Why Use an Influencer Marketing Dashboard? According to Influencer Marketing Hub, 67% of respondents intend to increase their influencer marketing spend in 2023. Given this trend, it's even more important for marketing teams to use an influencer marketing dashboard. Here are some of the key reasons why: Transparent and controllable visibility An influencer marketing dashboard provides real-time visibility into the performance of each influencer and the campaign. Marketing teams can track all essential metrics and ROI of campaigns to identify which influencers drive the most significant impact on their business goals. This helps teams optimize their influencer marketing strategy and achieve better results. Accountability With an influencer marketing dashboard companies can switch from quantitive to qualitative approach to influencer marketing. Instead of emphasizing the number of new and ongoing campaigns marketers arm themselves with required data to identify the most effective influencers, platforms, audiences, and more. The dashboard also helps teams to hold influencers accountable for underdelivering the expected results that are often stated in the agreement. For example, if the influencer intentionally misinformed you about their average performance metrics and you didn’t get the projected number of impressions or clicks, you can easily spot the issue and negotiate for new campaigns to make up for what’s been stated in the agreement. Continuous growth Sometimes, campaigns don’t drive the expected results, and it’s not the influencers' fault. Ill-fitting messaging, mistakes during audience research, or poorly designed banners may also result in underperforming campaigns and low ROI. However, an influencer marketing dashboard can help you overcome these issues by showing which of your campaigns perform better. With detailed stats into all campaigns available from one place you can analyze the compound results of all your campaigns as well as dig deeper into each of them to better understand why they overdeliver or underperform.These insights offer significant opportunities to optimize your campaigns and messages delivered to your audience.

Schedule a call What Metrics To Include In Influencer Marketing Dashboard When building an influencer marketing dashboard, it's crucial to track the right metrics to evaluate the performance of your influencer marketing campaigns. Here are the top metrics to include in your influencer marketing dashboard: Reach Reach is the total number of unique people who have seen an influencer's content. It's an essential metric to track because it measures the size of the audience that an influencer can reach. How to calculate Reach manually: To calculate Reach manually, you need to use the formula: Reach = (Impressions / Frequency) Where Impressions are the total number of times an influencer's content has been displayed, and Frequency is the average number of times each person has seen the content. Or, if we put it in math formula, it looks like this: Frequency = Impressions / Unique Users Why Reach is important: Reach helps businesses evaluate the campaign’s potential impact. The higher the Reach, the more people an influencer can potentially reach and the greater the potential impact on brand awareness, traffic, and sales. Engagement rate Influencer marketing dashboard: engagement rate by video Top influencer videos by views and engagement Engagement rate is the percentage of likes, comments, shares, and other interactions that the influencer’s content generate. It measures how well the audience engages with the content. How to calculate engagement manually To calculate engagement manually, you need to use the formula: Engagement = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Other Interactions) / Reach Likes, Comments, Shares, and Other Interactions are the total number of interactions an influencer's content has generated, and Reach is the number of unique people who have seen the content. Why Engagement Rate is important Engagement is an important metric to track because it measures how well the audience engages with an influencer's content. The higher the Engagement, the more likely the audience is to take action, such as visiting a website or purchasing. Usually, content with low engagement rate brings lower business results. Or, it can even signal that the influencer’s subscribers aren’t real people. Collaborating with such influencers may result in campaigns having high number of impressions but low conversion rates or not influencing the company’s bottom line. Click-Through Rate (CTR) CTR is the percentage of people clicking a link in an influencer's content. It measures how effectively an influencer's content drives traffic to your website, social media, etc. How to calculate CTR manually To calculate CTR manually, you need to use the formula: CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) x 100 Clicks are the total number of clicks on the link in an influencer's content, and Impressions are the total number of times the content has been displayed. ‍ Why CTR is important CTR is an important metric to track because it measures how effective an influencer's content is at driving traffic to your target destination. The higher the CTR, the more effective the content is at driving traffic and generating leads. Besides, it also indicates that the message you’re conveying is resonating with viewers. Meaning, you can reuse the same approach in other campaigns to achieve higher results. Conversion Rate Conversion rate is the percentage of people who complete a desired action after clicking on a link in an influencer's content. It measures how effective an influencer's content is at generating leads and sales. How to calculate conversion rate manually To calculate the conversion rate manually, you need to use the formula: Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions / Number of Clicks) x 100 The number of Conversions is the total number of people who complete the desired action after clicking on the link, and the Number of Clicks is the total number of clicks on the link in an influencer's content. Why Conversion Rate is important Conversion rate is an important metric to track because it measures how effectively an influencer's content generates leads and sales. The higher the conversion rate, the more effective the content drives Revenue and ROI. Remember that it’s crucial to set the right goals for each of your campaigns. For example, Google Analytics calculates the compound conversion rate for all of your goals. However, if your campaign aims for brand awareness it makes more sense to track pageviews and average number of pages viewed per attracted user than count the number of purchases or call reservations. Return on Investment (ROI) ROI measures the financial return generated from an influencer marketing campaign. It calculates the Revenue generated from the campaign compared to the total campaign cost. How to calculate ROI manually To calculate ROI manually, you need to use the formula: ROI = (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Cost x 100 Total Revenue is the total Revenue generated from the campaign, and Total Cost is the total сost. Why ROI is important ROI is a critical metric to track because it helps businesses evaluate the financial impact of their influencer marketing campaigns. By tracking ROI, businesses can determine whether their campaigns generate a positive return and adjust their strategy accordingly. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) CPA is the Cost of acquiring a new customer through an influencer marketing campaign. It measures the cost-effectiveness of the campaign in generating leads and sales. How to calculate CPA manually To calculate CPA manually, you need to use the formula: CPA = Total Cost / Number of Conversions Total Cost is the total cost of the campaign, and Number of Conversions is the total number of people who complete the desired action after clicking the link. Why CPA is important CPA is crucial to understand how cost-efficient your influencer campaigns are. By setting a CPA benchmark you can identify the campaigns that need optimization (actual CPA > benchmark CPA). Keeping your CPA as low as possible is vital to your budget and allows you make space for other campaigns and experiments to launch. Plus, the lower CPA you have the higher ROI of your marketing campaigns is. Brand Mentions Brand mentions are the number of times your brand gets mentioned in discussions on social media and other platforms. This metric helps you measure the recognizability of your brand and understand how prospects perceive your brand or product. How to calculate Brand Mentions To calculate brand mentions manually, you need to use social media listening tools that can track and measure the mentions of your brand on different platforms. By using these tools you can not only track the number of mentions, but also dive into different discussions and answer prospects’ questions to build more brand credibility. Why Brand Mentions are important Attributing each brand mention to a particular influencer campaign is tricky (if not impossible), because you can’t exactly identify which influencer’s post or video triggered the discussion. Still, sudden spikes of mentions after campaign launches show that the content gave rise to different discussions, which are common after your audience finds out about the product from their content creator. Now, it’s on you to monitor the quality of these discussions. If a user comments on strengths of your product, don’t hesitate to respond with a thank you message. On the other hand, if some users comment on any negative experiences they had with your product let them know that you’re working on improvements and invite them to give your product another try. As for brand mentions tracking, Improvado allows users to display all the comments from any social media platforms in a single, convenient dashboard. You can filter comments by subject or specific words to figure out the audience’s attitude to your brand and act accordingly. Total Revenue Total Revenue is the total revenue generated from an influencer marketing campaign. It measures the financial impact of the campaign on the business. How to calculate Total Revenue To calculate total revenue, you need to use your CRM system to track and measure the revenue generated from the influencer marketing campaign. Why Total Revenue is important Total Revenue metric is the backbone of marketing analytics. It allows you to measure the financial impact of each campaign on the business. Businesses make the majority of marketing decisions based on the generated revenue, so, this metric should never slip out of your attention. How to Build an Influencer Marketing Dashboard Influencer performance breakdown Measure the impact of each influencer on the company’s bottom line Now, when you have all the data you need to display on the dashboard, we’ll discuss the actual ways to display it. Since dashboard is a collective term for different means of displaying your data, there are several ways to build one. Let’s review three most tried and tested ways to gather your influencer metrics in one place: Use built-in dashboards provided by influencer marketing platforms Most influencer marketing platforms have built-in dashboards that allow users to track the performance of their campaigns. While these dashboards provide some level of insight, they are limited in their capabilities. Users can track the performance of their campaigns via platforms they use to find influencers. However, that quickly turns from a single source of truth to questioning “Where my metrics at?” if you use multiple platforms to collaborate with influencers. Platforms don’t integrate with each other, so you’ll have to jump around all of them to get a holistic view of your performance. And what’s more, you can’t see the entire impact of your cross-channel efforts. Let’s say, a prospect has landed on your website from an influencer campaign, but didn’t make a purchase. Then, they found your company’s social media account, went to your website again, and finally made the purchase. Built-in dashboards would say that the visit didn’t result in a conversion. But with a cross-channel view you can say for sure that this prospect has had their first touch with your brand via the influencer campaign and it resulted in a conversion. A built-in dashboard is a good option for starters that work with one or two influencers within the same platform. But, scaling becomes a nightmare in the long run, and you’ll most likely end up gathering all performance metrics manually when you’ll employ influencer directly or via another platform. Build a Spreadsheet-Based Dashboard Moving on, spreadsheet software is a viable option for those who need a quick way to gather influencer data in one place and visualize it. To build such a dashboard, you can use tools Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. You can create custom charts and graphs to visualize your data and use formulas to calculate metrics such as reach, engagement rate, CTR, and conversion rate. Spreadsheets are a cost-effective way to jumpstart your analytics without significant investment or engineering/analytics expertise. Simply copy data provided by influencers into a spreadsheet and create the required charts. The problem with spreadsheets is that you’re signing up for never-ending crunching of numbers, formulas, and metrics in this spreadsheet. The thing is, spreadsheets are all about manual operations. Manual data collection, cleaning, storing, organizing, etc. It’s not a big deal if you have only a few campaigns launched. But the things change when you’re dealing with hundreds of them. By the time you fill up the spreadsheet, your data becomes obsolete. Don’t forget to count in the human factor. Even a single mistake can render your dashboard useless. So, you need to have some data verification process in place to be sure of its quality. Of course, some platforms provide API integrations that can connect directly to your spreadsheet and pour it with data automatically. However, you still need to get rid of duplicates and cleanse your data manually. Plus, APIs require technical expertise, knowledge of the documentation, and regular maintenance. Wrapping up, spreadsheets are worth giving a try. If you’re tracking a couple of campaigns and don’t have loads of data to collect — go for spreadsheets. However, if you’re all about effective cross-channel marketing analytics and searching for a single source of truth for metrics across hundreds of campaigns, you should take a look at the next option.

The Top 7 Marketing Reporting Software Solutions for 2023 Whether you’re working for an agency or an in-house marketing team, your schedule can drastically change depending on the project. But there’s one task all marketers have in common: reporting. Basic data tracking, visualization, and reporting make up a decent portion of a marketing team’s time. Marketing reporting software can be incredibly valuable in automating the reporting process and saving your organization money and 27–40% of their time. This article will dive into the 7 best reporting tools for marketing and how you can use them to your advantage. What Is Marketing Reporting Software? The traditional approach to reporting is to grind away over a spreadsheet for the entire month, compiling data and quantifying metrics. The manual method has several downsides. For one, it's time-consuming and tedious. You have to go to dozens of marketing platforms, aggregate data from all ad accounts by hand, and then manually make unions and joins in an attempt to clean and normalize the data. Manual reporting efforts can also lead to errors and a lack of accuracy, significantly influencing the quality and speed of decision-making. Automated reporting is the way forward. Marketing reporting software is designed to help businesses and marketing teams track, analyze, and report on their marketing campaigns and initiatives. The software collects data from various marketing channels and provides insights into how well campaigns are performing, which tactics are working, and where improvements can be made. Marketing reporting tools typically include dashboard reporting, analytics, data visualization, and automation capabilities. The software lets marketers quickly generate reports summarizing key metrics, such as website traffic, leads generated, and sales revenue. This data can be used to measure campaigns' success, identify improvement areas, and make data-driven decisions to optimize future marketing initiatives and drive growth and revenue.

The limited filtering options of Whatagraph restrict advanced data analysis, making it challenging to analyze data sets that require more granular filtering and gain deeper insights. Whatagraph doesn't provide advanced analysis features. This may require businesses to supplement the platform with other tools or applications, which can be costly and time-consuming. Whatagraph serves as the final destination for your data—the tool doesn't push it to any external BI, analytics, or visualization tool. While the platform now supports warehouse integration and has started pushing data to BigQuery, this feature is still in beta. In general, the platform is more suitable for smaller businesses and marketing agencies.

The Klipfolio team provides professional services to help with customization.

Klipfolio's support for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and iframes allows users to get pixel-level control of visualization and get creative with their dashboard customization. Cons Klipfolio's broad application results in a lack of data granularity, meaning marketers won't be able to perform in-depth analysis.

The no-code nature and an emphasis on drag-and-drop functionality make the platform a good option for non-technical users and beginners. Cons Databox doesn't offer the same level of dashboard customization and control over data as other marketing reporting platforms. Current customers also note that custom mapping within the platform can be challenging to achieve. There have been complaints from some customers regarding the quality of data source connectors. Sometimes, connection with the source is lost, resulting in the loss of historical data vital for reporting. Pricing Databox offers a free account option that allows users to get started on the platform. However, this option is limited to only three data source connection points. Paid plans on the platform include Starter, Professional, and Performer: The Starter plan costs $72 per month, providing four data source connections and databoards.

Cons AgencyAnalytics supports only basic data transformation capabilities, which are suitable for small businesses but cannot meet the needs of mid-market and enterprise companies. AgencyAnalytics doesn't push data to BI, visualization, or analytics tools, nor does it support integration with data warehouses. Thus, clients don't have an opportunity to dig into raw data or build more complex visualizations. In general, the platform is more suitable for small-scale marketing agencies.

The unique pay-per-go pricing model restrains Looker Studio customers from scaling operations. Pricing Enterprise customers can upgrade to Looker Studio Pro to receive support and expanded administrative features. Upgrading requires a Google Cloud account. How to Choose a Marketing Reporting Tool When choosing marketing reporting software, there is rarely an all-in-one option. Even if the software claims it can handle everything, chances are there will be one or two holes in the feature set. Every marketing team is different, and what’s “all-in-one” to you may not be to someone else. Still, there are a few features every marketing team should look for in a reporting tool. 1. Automation A marketing reporting tool lacking automation isn’t worth your time. A huge benefit to investing in this type of software is the ability to streamline your workflow and increase productivity. Automation is the way forward, which makes it a critical element in your marketing reporting software. 2. Customization There’s no one-size-fits-all model for marketing reporting tools, so your chosen software needs to allow for customization. Determining which metrics are most vital to your organization and which you want to display for your clients is a critical part of the process. Your marketing channel focus is another crucial factor. If you work with Facebook and LinkedIn more than web content, you likely need to prioritize social media on your dashboard. In this case, you need a flexible dashboard and capable reporting software. All businesses must have the scalability conversation at some point. Automated reporting tools allow you to grow more quickly and easily. 3. Visualization While this might be optional for certain companies and isn’t included in every marketing reporting software, visualization can be critical. A key benefit of investment in reporting and analytics tools is the ability to showcase your data in a digestible format. For most marketing teams, a robust data visualization option is non-negotiable. Look for software that displays your data in a way that feels intuitive to your workflow to make integration seamless.

Instagram Analytics Dashboard: The Best Solution for Tracking Social Media Metrics Instagram is a central hub for sharing content, experiences, thoughts, and perspectives. And it's only growing. In terms of engagement rate Instagram confidently holds second place after Tiktok. Even though Instagram's 0,6% is well away from TikTok's whopping 4,25%, it's still miles better than Facebook's 0,15% and Twitter's 0,05%. For anyone wondering if Instagram is still relevant to their business, consider that it's still the most downloaded app in the world (followed by TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp, respectively). However, advertising on Instagram without analyzing your marketing efforts may quickly drain your marketing budget. In this guide, we discuss how to build a comprehensive Instagram analytics dashboard, what metrics to include, and how to get the most out of Instagram data. Key Takeaways Social media analytics is crucial to a successful marketing strategy. Instagram is a relevant platform for numerous industries and is still growing. Using an Instagram dashboard is an effective way to visualize your data. Third-party dashboard tools are more efficient than Instagram’s in-app offering in almost every scenario. Some of the most important metrics to track on Instagram are engagement rates, impressions, follower growth, and top-performing posts. Three best practices for building an Instagram dashboard include combining data to see the big picture, automating the process where possible, and using data to visualize and tell a story. Marketing analytics platforms can streamline your Instagram analytics experience and provide actionable insights. Why Instagram Analytics Matter Which one of your recent posts got the most engagement in the past two weeks? How about last month? Which hashtags are the most valuable for your audience? Which ones are you using most frequently? These are important questions that require answers if you want to achieve more with your marketing campaigns, creatives, or messaging. Tracking your Instagram metrics will help you find those answers. Consider the following allegory. When you’re sick, you go to the doctor. A healthcare professional runs various tests and analyzes your symptoms. With all the data, they can find out what’s malfunctioning inside your body. Then, doctors and nurses pull all the reports and charts together to understand the full scope of your condition. Monitoring Instagram engagement metrics is about the same thing. With all the data about your Instagram efforts, you can diagnose what isn’t working—and adjust your strategy accordingly. A insights-driven strategy considers all past mistakes and failures. This guarantees more cost-efficient and scalable campaigns. Why You Should Use an Instagram Dashboard When you think about analytics for Instagram, you likely envision long, grueling spreadsheets and enormous piles of data. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Manual reporting and building charts in spreadsheets is only good if you need to test something or find a quick answer to your question. However, using this approach in your day-to-day activities always results in wasted time and untrustworthy data. And - why so? Copypasting Instagram metrics to your spreadsheet will eventually result in mistakes. You either accept this fact or spend more time double checking your data. Now, imaging running hundreds of campaigns, collecting all that data, and gazing at each data cell afterwards to find a mistake. It easily away the better part of the week if you want to have data worth working with. On the other hand you have an Instagram analytics dashboard. With its help you can represent your data in any way you want in a convenient interface of popular BI tools. From simple line charts to mosaic and scatter plots, you can show your data any way you want. If Instagram is your main acquisition source, your business could benefit from a dedicated Instagram analytics dashboard for better transparency, visibility, and accountability for marketing activities. Jumpstart your Instagram analytics with Improvado BOOK A CALL The Basics of Instagram Analytics There are two ways to monitor your Instagram analytics and visualize your data: Use a third-party dashboard builder Use Instagram’s in-app analytics platform. Both carry pros and cons, so let’s start with an overview of the in-app offering. In-App Analytics Instagram’s in-app analytics is a useful resource for marketing professionals, but it comes with a decent number of limitations. The built-in reporting tool provides basic insights into your account performance, which can be useful when checking on a data point you’re already familiar with. Instagram’s platform can offer fundamental insights into performance metrics such as: Reach Followers Engagement Advertising results Post-specific data And more So, if Instagram already provides professional accounts with in-app analytics (and even a dashboard overview), why consider a third-party tool? There’s actually more than just one reason. Third-Party Tools A third-party analytics tool is essential for marketing professionals who need more than a basic glance at simple metrics. You can find robust, feature-rich platforms that allow you to create beautiful-yet-understandable dashboards featuring advanced performance metrics. While in-app analytics provides just the basic performance metrics, such as reach, clicks, and engaged accounts, third-party tools allow you to calculate metrics more valuable to your business, such as CAC, cost per engaged account, revenue generated by paid and organic posts, and more. You also get much better visualization capabilities compared to Instagram’s basic in-app charts. Since Instagram is optimized for mobile, the app’s provided analytics are also mobile-oriented. This can be a significant limiting factor, making reporting challenging or even completely inaccessible. Using a robust third-party dashboard means you can dive deeper into your reports on your desktop or laptop as well, expanding the scope of your analytical efforts. But the true killer feature of third-party analytics tools is that they allow to merge Instagram data with performance metrics from other channels on a single dashboard. And that means you can understand how your Instgram campaigns compare to other channels and what practices from other platforms you can implement to improve your Instagram account performance. Besides, a comprehensive dashboard may help you capture trends faster and make informed decisions about your overall marketing strategy. Take a look at Improvado’s organic social dashboard that allows you to explore posts, reach, views, engagement rates, and clicks across all your social channels. Having both quick overview of your channels and detailed breakdown of each campaign’s performance improves decision-making and facilitates campaign optimization. Improvado’s organic social dashboard Now, it’s time to understand which metrics are key for the platform and how to track them on your dashboard. Instagram Metrics to Include In the Dashboard As with any marketing channel, your data is only as good as the metrics you’re tracking. That’s why it’s essential to grasp which metrics matter most to the individual platform or a group of platforms you’re visualizing on a dashboard. Social media comes with different factors when compared to web content, though each platform has its own KPIs. On Instagram, you’re concerned with the amount of engagement you receive, just like on other social media platforms. However, there is an increased focus on follower growth. It’s one of the most important metrics to monitor. Below, you’ll find some of the most important metrics to track when building your analytics platform: Engagement Rate Instagram engagement rate chart‍ Social media marketing is about one thing above all others—engagement. Though you can pop into your audience's inbox with email marketing and develop valuable resources on your website, no marketing channel facilitates direct engagement quite like social media. Instagram is no exception, which is why it’s vital to track your engagement rate. Think of engagement rate tracking as keeping a pulse on your Instagram marketing efforts. This metric acts as a lifeline, letting you know how things are truly doing. Your engagement rate is the percentage of your following that regularly interacts with your content, considering the number of likes and comments you receive on a post in relation to your overall follower count. Impressions daily impressions chart If you’ve ever dabbled in analytics, you’re likely already familiar with this metric. Impressions on Instagram work largely in the same way they do on the web. This metric is tracking the number of people who have been exposed to your account. You can filter that data by a specified period if you want to understand how a certain campaign has impacted your impressions. Follower Growth Follower tracking on Instagram is similarly crucial. Unlike simply tracking the number of likes you’re getting on a post, your follower growth is not a vanity metric. You aren’t just keeping tabs on your existing follower count—you’re actively monitoring the growth rate of your following. Gaining a large number of followers quickly doesn’t always equate to actual conversions, but that doesn’t mean your following shouldn’t grow steadily if your campaigns are effective. Tracking your follower growth is important to see whether you’re trending upward or downward. Top Performing Posts Another common social media metric that remains applicable and valuable for Instagram is your top-performing posts. When your team begins crafting the next campaign, knowing what has worked best in the past is helpful. This can assist you in understanding what your audience is drawn to and how to reach them in future campaigns.

To do that, follow these best practices for building an Instagram data hub. Combine Data to See the Big Picture Using a dashboard can be incredibly beneficial in allowing teams to see the big picture. With in-app analytics your marketing vision is limited to a single channel. But a dashboard lets you combine your data and KPIs into a single source of truth to get a bird’s-eye-view. So, combining your data is crucial to make unbiased decisions and optimize your cross-channel marketing effort. Automate When Possible Automation is critical in any analytics-tracking venture.

Use a Marketing Analytics Platform to Squeeze the Most out of Instagram Data Focusing on social media performance is crucial to understanding marketing’s team impact on the organization’s bottom line.
